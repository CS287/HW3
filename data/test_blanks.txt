nevertheless the company 's reaction <unk> the <unk> effect that a huge manufacturer such as boeing can _203_ on other parts of the economy
it also is sure to help _204_ machinists put added pressure on the company
_205_ just do n't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged <unk> tom baker president of machinists ' district N said in an interview yesterday
i _206_ n't think their customers would like it very much
america west _207_ is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be
i figure that american and united probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their _208_ they might not miss one at all mr. <unk> said
indeed a random check friday did n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations
southwest airlines has a boeing N set for delivery at the end of _210_ month and expects to have the plane on time
it 's so close to completion boeing 's told _211_ there wo n't be a problem said a southwest spokesman
a spokesman for amr corp. said boeing _212_ assured american airlines it will deliver a N on time later this month

we want to make sure they _218_ what they want before they come back said doug hammond the federal mediator who has been in contact with both sides since the strike began
the investment _219_ for one has been anticipating a <unk> resolution
though boeing 's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market friday it actually has risen over the last _220_ weeks on the strength of new orders
the market has taken two views that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look _221_ <unk> for boeing in the long term said howard <unk> an analyst at <unk> j. lawrence inc
boeing 's shares fell $ N friday to close at $ N in composite trading on _222_ new york stock exchange
but mr. baker said he thinks the earliest a pact could be struck would be the end of this month <unk> that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week
still he _224_ it 's possible that the strike could last considerably longer
i would n't expect an immediate resolution to anything
last week _226_ chairman frank <unk> sent striking workers a letter saying that to my knowledge boeing 's offer represents the best overall three-year contract of any major u.s. industrial firm in recent history
but mr. baker called the letter and the company 's offer of a N N wage increase _227_ the life of the pact plus bonuses very weak

mr. <unk> said of the boom it 's going _280_ last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks
but now prices have <unk> and quantum 's _281_ is <unk>
some securities analysts are looking for no better than break-even results from the company for the third quarter compared with year-earlier profit of $ N million or $ N a share on _282_ of $ N million
the stock having lost nearly a quarter of its value since sept. N closed at $ N share _283_ $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading friday
to a degree quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity plastics that <unk> _284_ life
having just passed through _285_ of the most profitable periods in their history these producers now see their prices eroding
pricing cycles to be sure _286_ nothing new for plastics producers
and the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with _287_ <unk> period that is just behind them
we were all wonderful heroes last year says an executive _288_ one of quantum 's competitors
now we 're at the bottom _289_ the <unk>
at quantum which _290_ based in new york the trouble is magnified by the company 's heavy <unk> on plastics
once known as national <unk> & chemical corp. the company <unk> the wine and spirits business and <unk> more of its resources into _291_ after mr. <unk> took the chief executive 's job in N
_292_ <unk> N years old declined to be interviewed for this article but he has consistently argued that over the long haul across both the <unk> and the <unk> of the plastics market quantum will <unk> through its new direction
_293_ 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene <unk> used to make garbage bags milk <unk> <unk> toys and meat packaging among other items
_294_ the u.s. polyethylene market quantum has claimed the largest share about N N
but its competitors including dow chemical co. union carbide corp. and several oil giants have much broader business interests and so are better _295_ against price swings
when the price of polyethylene moves a mere _296_ a pound quantum 's annual profit <unk> by about N cents a share provided no other <unk> are changing
in recent months the price of polyethylene even more than that of other commodity plastics has taken a dive
benchmark grades which still sold for as _298_ as N cents a pound last spring have skidded to between N cents and N cents
meanwhile the price of <unk> the chemical building block of polyethylene has n't dropped _299_ so fast
that <unk> <unk> quantum badly because its own plants _300_ only about half of its <unk> needs
by many accounts an early hint of a price rout in the making came at _301_ start of this year
china which had _302_ putting in huge orders for polyethylene abruptly halted them
<unk> _303_ excess polyethylene would soon be <unk> around the world other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new product
kenneth mitchell director of dow 's polyethylene business says producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices _304_ up
people were _305_ <unk> bags he says
_306_ producers hope prices have hit bottom
they recently announced increases of a few _307_ a pound to take effect in the next several weeks
no one knows however whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to _308_
one <unk> is george <unk> a <unk> analyst at oppenheimer _309_ co. and a bear on plastics stocks
noting others ' estimates of when price increases can be sustained he remarks _310_ say october

he _313_ that efforts to firm up prices will be undermined by producers ' plans to expand production capacity
a quick turnaround is crucial to quantum _314_ its cash requirements remain heavy
the company is trying to carry out a three-year $ N billion <unk> program started this year
at the same time its annual payments on long-term debt will more than _316_ from a year ago to about $ N million largely because of debt taken on to pay a $ <unk> special dividend earlier this year
quantum described the payout at the _317_ as a way for it to share the <unk> with its holders because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases
some analysts _318_ the payment as an effort also to <unk> takeover speculation
whether a cash crunch might eventually force the company to cut its quarterly dividend raised N N to N cents a share only _319_ year ago has become a topic of intense speculation on wall street since mr. <unk> <unk> dividend questions in a sept. N meeting with analysts
some viewed his response that company directors review the dividend _320_ as nothing more than the standard line from executives
but others came _321_ thinking he had given something less than his usual <unk> performance
in any case on the day of the meeting quantum 's shares slid $ N to $ N in big board trading
on top of everything else quantum <unk> a disaster at its plant in morris _323_
_324_ an explosion <unk> the plant in june the company <unk> in september to within N hours of completing the <unk> process of <unk> it
then a second _325_ occurred

this human toll adds the most painful <unk> yet to the sudden change in quantum 's _327_
until this year the company _328_ been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up <unk> safety <unk>
a prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce _329_ <unk> into quantum 's financial future
when _330_ plant has just been running flat out to meet demand <unk> lost profit and thus claims under <unk> insurance is <unk>
but the numbers become <unk> and subject to <unk> _331_ insured and insurer when demand is shifting
you say you could have sold x percent of this product and <unk> percent of that recalls <unk> <unk> an analyst at shearson lehman hutton who went through this exercise during _332_ former career as a chemical engineer
and then you still _333_ to negotiate
quantum hopes the morris plant where limited production got under way last week will resume full _334_ by year 's end
the plant usually accounts for N N to N N of quantum 's polyethylene production and N N of its <unk> production
not everything _336_ grim for quantum
the plant expansion should strengthen the company 's <unk> in the _337_ business where market share is often taken through sheer capacity
by lifting <unk> production _338_ expansion will also lower the company 's raw material costs
quantum is _339_ tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals propane marketing
through a venture with its _340_ banker first boston corp. quantum completed in august an acquisition of <unk> inc. in a transaction valued at $ N billion
<unk> is the second-largest propane distributor in the u.s.
the largest suburban propane was already _342_ by quantum

an executive close to the company said rjr is spending about $ _351_ million on network television time this year down from roughly $ N million last year
the spokesman said the _352_ unit will be <unk> dec. N and the move wo n't affect rjr 's print radio and <unk> buying practices
the broadcast group had been based in new york until a year ago when rjr 's previous management moved it to atlanta the company 's headquarters before this summer
one employee with the group said rjr moved N employees of the group back to new york in september because there was supposed to be a future
he said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks _355_ them from jobs with advertising agencies
the rjr spokesman said the company _356_ the N employees to new york last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks ' <unk> season

meanwhile the u.s. has negotiated a significant cut _360_ japan 's steel quota and made only a minor increase to the steel <unk> for the european community
brazil similar to mexico and south korea is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the u.s. market than it _361_ under the previous five-year steel quotas which expired sept. N
brazil and venezuela are the only two countries that have n't completed steel talks with the u.s. for the year ending oct. N _362_
in recent years u.s. steelmakers have supplied about N N of _363_ N million tons of steel used annually by the nation
of _364_ remaining N N needed the <unk> negotiations <unk> about N N to foreign suppliers with the difference supplied mainly by canada which is n't included in the quota program
other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the u.s. such as taiwan sweden _365_ argentina also have supplied steel
some of these countries have in recent years _366_ informal agreements with the u.s. that are similar to quotas
the bush administration earlier this year said it would _367_ steel quotas known as voluntary restraint agreements until march N N
it also said it would use that <unk> year period to work toward an international consensus on <unk> up the international steel trade which has been <unk> managed subsidized and _368_ by governments
the u.s. termed its plan a trade <unk> program despite _369_ fact that it is merely an extension
mexico which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the u.s. virtually doubled its quota to N N of the u.s. steel _370_ from N N under the previous quotas
south korea which had N N _371_ the previous quotas is set to get a small increase to about N N
that increase rises to slightly more than N N of the u.s. market if a joint _372_ steel project is included
meanwhile _373_ is expected to increase its allowance from the N N share it has had in recent years
the _374_ and japan the u.s. 's largest steel suppliers have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent
the ec steel industry which _375_ been coping with strong european demand has been supplying about N N of the u.s. market compared with recent quotas of about N N
japan has been shipping steel to total _376_ N N of the u.s. market compared with a quota of N N
in the recent talks the ec had its quota increased about N tons to N N of the u.s. market from N N in N
_378_ its quota has been as high as N N in N
japan however has agreed to cut its quota to about N N from N N _379_
japan the ec brazil mexico and south korea provide about N N of the steel _380_ to the u.s. under the quota program
the balance is supplied by a _381_ of smaller exporters such as australia and venezuela
the u.s. had about an extra N N of _382_ domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks
that _383_ essentially made up of a N N increase in the overall quota program and N N from cutting japan 's allowance
negotiators from the white _384_ trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another N N of the u.s. steel market to <unk>
these <unk> _385_ increases to the steel quota program are built into the bush administration 's <unk> program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and <unk> from their own steel industries
<unk> inc. expects fiscal second-quarter earnings to trail N results but anticipates that several new products will lead to _386_ much stronger performance in its second half
<unk> a telecommunications company had net income of $ N or five cents a share _387_ its year-earlier second quarter ended sept. N
revenue totaled $ N million
george <unk> chairman and chief executive officer said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two _389_ a share on revenue of just under $ N million
the lower results mr. <unk> said reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones <unk> 's primary _390_
although mr. <unk> expects that line of business to strengthen _391_ the next year he said <unk> will also benefit from moving into other areas
_392_ among those is the company 's <unk> into the public facsimile business mr. <unk> said
within the next year <unk> expects _393_ place N fax machines made by <unk> in japan in hotels municipal buildings <unk> and other public <unk> around the country
<unk> will provide a credit-card reader for the machines to _394_ store and forward billing data
mr. <unk> said <unk> should realize a minimum of $ N of <unk> net earnings for _395_ machine each month
<unk> has also developed an automatic call <unk> that will make further use _396_ the company 's system for <unk> and handling credit-card calls and collect calls
automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone mr. <unk> said not just _397_ produced by <unk>
the company will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones which do n't _398_ coins for use in hotel <unk> office <unk> <unk> <unk> and similar <unk>

the move stems _406_ <unk> learned in japan where local competitors have had <unk> success with concentrated <unk>
it also marks p&g 's _407_ concern that its japanese rivals such as <unk> corp. may bring their <unk> to the u.s.
the cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in japan when <unk> introduced a powerful detergent _408_ attack which quickly won a N N stake in the japanese markets
they do _409_ want to get caught again says one industry <unk>
retailers in phoenix ariz. say p&g 's new <unk> detergent to be called <unk> with color guard will be on shelves in _410_ market by early november
a p&g spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to _411_ started late last month
she _412_ the company will study results from this market before expanding to others
_413_ are n't entirely new for p&g
the company _414_ a <unk> <unk> <unk> in japan after watching the success of attack
when attack hit the shelves in N p&g 's share of the japanese market _415_ to about N N from more than N N
with the help of <unk> <unk> p&g 's share _416_ now estimated to be N N
while the japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products the true test for p&g will be in the $ N billion u.s. detergent _417_ where growth is slow and <unk> have gained <unk> over <unk>
the company may have chosen to market the product under _418_ <unk> name since it 's already expanded its <unk> tide into N different <unk> including this year 's big hit tide with <unk>
with <unk> however it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more many people tend to dump too much _419_ into the <unk> machine <unk> that it takes a cup of <unk> to really clean the <unk>
in the early 1980s p&g tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the <unk> brand name that _420_ markets in europe
but the product which was n't as concentrated as the new <unk> <unk> in _421_ market test in denver and was dropped
p&g and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric <unk> <unk> in <unk> but _422_ have n't sold well despite the convenience
but p&g contends the new <unk> is a unique formula that also offers an <unk> _423_ prevents colors from <unk>
_424_ retailers are expected to <unk> the product in part because it will take up less shelf space
when shelf space was cheap bigger was better says <unk> <unk> an analyst at _425_ <unk>
but _426_ so many brands <unk> for space that 's no longer the case
_427_ the new <unk> sells well the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own <unk>
then retailers will probably _428_ the <unk> brands out altogether he says
competition is bound to get tougher if _429_ <unk> a product like attack in the u.s.
to be sure <unk> would n't have an easy time taking u.s. market _430_ away from the mighty p&g which has about N N of the market
<unk> officials previously have said they are interested in selling <unk> in the u.s. but so far the company has focused on acquisitions such as last year 's _431_ of andrew <unk> co. a cincinnati <unk> maker
it also has a <unk> facility in _432_
some believe p&g 's interest in a <unk> detergent goes beyond _433_ concern for the japanese
this is something p&g would do with or without <unk> _434_ mr. <unk>

mr. mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental japanese _439_ practices that supposedly inhibit free trade
he said such results should _440_ <unk> in dollars and cents in reducing the u.s. trade deficit with japan
but mrs. hills speaking at a breakfast meeting of the american chamber of commerce in japan on saturday stressed that the objective is not to get definitive _441_ by spring or summer it is rather to have a blueprint for action
she added that she expected perhaps to have a down payment some small step to convince the american people and the japanese people that we 're moving in <unk>
how such remarks _443_ into policy wo n't become clear for months
american and japanese officials offered _444_ theories for the difference in approach <unk> mr. mosbacher and mrs. hills
many called it simply a _445_ in styles

asked to compare her visit to mr. mosbacher 's mrs. hills replied i did n't hear every word he spoke but as a general _449_ i think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the bush administration
yet more than one american official who sat in with her during three days of talks with japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly <unk>
i think my line has been very consistent _451_ hills said at a news conference saturday afternoon
i am painted sometimes as <unk> perhaps because i have a _452_ list of statutes to implement

mrs. hills ' remarks did raise questions at least among _463_ u.s. officials about what exactly her stance is on u.s. access to the japanese semiconductor market

in the latest nine months net income was $ N million or $ N a _474_ on revenue of $ N million
separately the company said it would file a delayed <unk> report with the _475_ and exchange commission within approximately N days

the oil industry 's <unk> profits could <unk> through the _488_ of the year
major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than _489_ did for the third quarter a year ago largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability
the gasoline picture may improve this quarter but chemicals are likely to remain weak industry executives and _490_ say reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance
the industry is seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals glenn cox president of phillips petroleum _491_ said in an interview
that change _492_ obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings for the industry in general he added
he did n't _493_ phillips 's results
but securities analysts say phillips _494_ be among the companies <unk> by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings
so too many analysts predict will exxon _495_ chevron corp. and amoco corp
typical is what happened to the price of <unk> a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil _496_
it has plunged N N since july to around N cents _497_ pound
a year ago <unk> sold _498_ N cents <unk> at about N cents last december
_499_ big reason for the chemical price retreat is <unk>
beginning in <unk> prices _500_ accelerating as a growing u.s. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand
companies added capacity <unk>
now greatly increased supplies are on the market while the dollar is stronger and domestic economic growth is _502_
third-quarter profits from _503_ were weaker
refining margins were so good in _504_ third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year said william <unk> a securities analyst at first boston corp
oil company refineries ran flat out to _505_ for a robust holiday driving season in july and august that did n't <unk>
the _506_ supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period
in addition crude oil prices were up some from a year _507_ further <unk> profitability
refiners say margins picked up in september and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter though still not to the level of N 's fourth _508_
during the _509_ second half many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits
crude oil production may turn _510_ to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year
prices averaging roughly _511_ N a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier have stayed well above most companies ' expectations
demand has been much stronger than anticipated _512_ it typically <unk> in the fourth quarter
we could see higher oil prices this year said <unk> <unk> an analyst _513_ painewebber inc
that will translate into sharply higher production profits particularly compared with last year _514_ oil prices steadily fell to below $ N a barrel in the fourth quarter
while oil prices have been better than _515_ natural gas prices have been worse
in the third quarter _516_ averaged about N N less than they were in N
the main _517_ remains weather
last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to <unk> more natural gas to feed increased _518_ demand from air <unk> use
this summer on the other hand had <unk> weather than usual
we 've been very disappointed in the performance _520_ natural gas prices said mr. cox phillips 's president
the lagging gas price is not going to _521_ fourth quarter performance as many had expected
going into the fourth _522_ natural gas prices are anywhere from N N to N N lower than a year earlier
for instance natural gas currently produced along the gulf _523_ is selling on the spot market for around $ N a thousand cubic feet down N N from $ N a thousand cubic feet a year ago
the bush administration trying to blunt growing demands from western europe for a <unk> of _524_ on exports to the soviet bloc is questioning whether italy 's <unk> c. olivetti & co. supplied <unk> valuable technology to the soviets
most of the western european members of <unk> committee on <unk> export controls the <unk> forum through which _525_ u.s. and its allies <unk> their <unk> policies are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in paris oct. N and N
they plan to press specifically for _526_ <unk> of rules governing exports of machine tools computers and other high-technology products
but the bush administration says it wants _527_ see evidence that all cocom members are <unk> fully with existing <unk> procedures before it will support further <unk>
to make its point it is challenging the italian government to explain reports that olivetti may have supplied the soviet union with sophisticated computer-driven devices _528_ could be used to build parts for combat aircraft
_529_ london sunday times which first reported the u.s. concerns cited a u.s. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that olivetti exported $ N million in <unk> <unk> flexible manufacturing systems to the soviet aviation industry
olivetti reportedly began shipping these _530_ in N
a state department spokesman acknowledged that the u.s. is discussing the allegations with the italian government and cocom but _531_ to confirm any details
italian _532_ <unk> <unk> promised a quick investigation into whether olivetti broke cocom rules
president _533_ called his attention to the matter during the italian leader 's visit here last week
olivetti has _534_ that it violated cocom rules <unk> that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the italian authorities
although the _535_ of these sales is still an open question the disclosure could n't be better <unk> to support the position of <unk> <unk> in the pentagon and the intelligence community
it seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important cocom meeting said a washington lobbyist for a number of u.s. computer companies
the bush administration has sent <unk> _537_ about its <unk> policies reflecting <unk> divisions among several competing agencies
last summer mr. bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual <unk> when he told a north atlantic treaty organization meeting that he would allow some _538_ to the cocom <unk> of strategic goods
_539_ more recently the pentagon and the commerce department openly <unk> over the extent to which cocom should <unk> exports of personal computers to the bloc
however these agencies generally agree that the west should be cautious about _540_ further <unk>
there 's no evidence that the soviet program to illegally acquire western technology has diminished said a state department spokesman

the move closely follows a similar offer by salomon of warrants for shares of _543_ & shanghai banking corp
under the latest offer hk$ N million us$ N million of three-year warrants will be issued in london each giving buyers the _544_ to buy one hong kong telecommunications share at a price to be determined friday

in trading on the stock exchange of hong kong the shares closed _546_ at hk$ N each

while hong kong companies have in the past issued warrants on their own shares salomon 's warrants _548_ the first here to be issued by a third party
salomon will cover the warrants by buying sufficient shares or options to purchase shares to _549_ its entire position
bankers said warrants for hong kong stocks are attractive because they give foreign investors wary of _550_ in the colony 's stock market an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk

it was near the low range of estimates _599_ N million <unk> boxes compared with N million boxes last season
however as expected brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its <unk> concentrate _600_ about $ N a pound from around $ N
friday 's <unk> selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the _601_ report might have had and sent the november orange <unk> contract down as much as N cents a pound at one time
it settled with a _602_ of N cents at $ N a pound
brazilian <unk> after a delay caused by drought at _603_ start of its crop season is beginning to arrive in the u.s. in large quantities
brazil wants to stimulate demand for its _604_ which is going to be in <unk> supply
the price cut one analyst said appeared to be aimed even more at _605_ where consumption of brazilian <unk> has fallen
it 's a _606_ product and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in europe the analyst said
new york futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $ N _607_ pound at midyear

general _727_ corp. in a series of moves that angered union officials in the u.s. and canada has signaled that as many as five north american assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation struggles to cut its excess <unk> capacity
in announcements to workers late last week gm effectively signed _728_ <unk> for two <unk> van assembly plants and cast serious doubt on the futures of three u.s. car factories
gm is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker 's u.s. market share _729_ during the past decade
the _730_ currently using about N N of its north american vehicle capacity has vowed it will run at N N of capacity by N
just a month ago gm announced it would make an aging assembly plant in <unk> _731_ the eighth u.s. assembly facility to close since N
now gm appears to be stepping up _732_ pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s
one reason is _733_ competition from new japanese car plants in the u.s. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than gm can match
another is that united auto workers union officials _734_ signaled they want tighter <unk> provisions in the new big three national contract that will be negotiated next year
gm _735_ want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin
the problem however is that gm 's moves are coming at a time when <unk> leaders are trying to <unk> <unk> who charge the _736_ is too passive in the face of gm layoffs
against that backdrop <unk> vice president stephen p. <unk> who recently became head of the union 's gm department issued a statement friday <unk> gm 's <unk> _737_ toward union members
the auto maker 's decision to let _738_ of the latest <unk> and product <unk> <unk> out in separate <unk> to the affected plants showed disarray and an inability or <unk> to provide consistent information mr. <unk> said
gm officials told workers late last week of the following moves production of <unk> vans will _739_ consolidated into a single plant in <unk> mich
that means two plants one in <unk> ontario and the other _740_ <unk> ohio probably will be shut down after the end of N
the <unk> _741_ idle about N canadian assembly workers and about N workers in ohio
robert white canadian auto workers union president used the impending <unk> shutdown to <unk> the <unk> free trade agreement and its champion prime minister _742_ <unk>

workers at plants in van <unk> calif. oklahoma city and <unk> mich. were told their facilities are no longer being considered _744_ build the next generation of the <unk> <unk> and chevrolet <unk> muscle cars
gm is studying whether it can build the new <unk> profitably at a plant in st. <unk> quebec _745_ and union officials said
that announcement left union officials in van <unk> _746_ oklahoma city uncertain about their futures
the van <unk> plant which _747_ about N workers does n't have a product to build after N
jerry <unk> <unk> local president said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a <unk> plant which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand

at <unk> however the <unk> decision appears to <unk> <unk> hopes that gm would reopen the <unk> assembly plant that last built the <unk> <unk> <unk> _751_ model
the <unk> plant was viewed as a model of <unk> cooperation at gm before slow sales of the <unk> forced the _752_ to close the factory last year

canadian investment rules require _757_ big foreign takeovers meet that standard
the french company said the government gave it N days _758_ which to submit information to further support its takeover plan
both merieux and connaught are biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing _759_
_760_ government 's action was unusual
alan <unk> executive vice president of investment canada which oversees foreign takeovers said _761_ marked the first time in its four-year history that the agency has made an adverse <unk> decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded company
he said it has reached the same conclusions about _762_ attempts to buy closely held concerns but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed
this is n't a change in government policy this provision has been used before said <unk> redmond press secretary for <unk> <unk> canada 's minister of _763_ science and technology
mr. <unk> issued the ruling based on a recommendation by investment _764_

this has become a very <unk> deal concerning canada 's only large <unk> <unk> or pharmaceutical company mr. _768_ said
mr. mehta said the move that could allow the transaction _769_ go ahead as planned could be an <unk> settlement of connaught 's dispute with the university of toronto
the university is seeking to block the acquisition of connaught by foreign interests citing concerns _770_ the amount of research that would be done in canada
the _771_ is considering a settlement proposal made by connaught
while neither side will disclose its <unk> mr. mehta expects it to contain more specific _772_ on research and development spending levels in canada than merieux offered to investment canada

analysts said that merck & co. eli lilly & co. warner-lambert co. and the squibb corp. unit of _788_ squibb co. all benefited from strong sales of relatively new <unk> <unk> that provide wide profit margins
less robust earnings at pfizer inc. and upjohn co. were attributed to those companies ' older products many of which face <unk> competition from generic drugs _789_ other <unk>
joseph <unk> an analyst with bear stearns & co. said that over the past few years most drug makers have shed their <unk> businesses and instituted other cost savings such as consolidating _790_ plants and administrative staffs
as a result major new products are having significant impact even on a company with very large revenues mr. <unk> _791_

the company said that as part of its agreement with the epa _878_ made certain voluntary <unk> with respect to <unk> transactions entered into after the reorganization
the company which issued a statement on the agreement late friday said that $ N million of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and _879_ $ N will be recognized in its N third-quarter statement
the agreement and consent <unk> are subject _880_ court approval the company said
gulf resources added that it will seek to recover equitable contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities _881_ may incur under the superfund law
under the agreement gulf must give the u.s. government N days ' advance written notice _882_ issuing any dividends on common stock
the _883_ 's net worth can not fall below $ N million after the dividends are issued
the terms of that agreement only become effective the _884_ of gulf 's reorganization which we anticipate will occur sometime in early N said lawrence r. mehl gulf 's general counsel
in addition gulf must give the government N days ' advance written notice of any loans exceeding $ N million _885_ are made to the <unk> holding company
gulf 's net worth after those transaction must be _886_ least $ N million
separately the company said it expects _887_ hold a special meeting for shareholders in early N to vote on its proposed reorganization
many of the nation 's <unk> executives <unk> friday 's market plunge as an overdue <unk> for _888_ and takeover players
assuming that the market does n't head _889_ a <unk> free fall some executives think friday 's action could prove a <unk> of good news as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be <unk>
this is a reaction to <unk> lbo <unk> rather than to _890_ fundamentals said john young chairman of hewlett-packard co. whose shares dropped $ N to $ N
if we get rid of a lot of that nonsense _891_ will be a big plus
a few of the executives here for the fall _892_ of the business council a group that meets to discuss national issues were only too happy to <unk> their criticism
people wish the government would do something about leveraged buy-outs do something about takeovers _893_ something about donald trump said rand <unk> chairman of itt corp. whose stock dropped $ N
where 's the leadership
where 's the guy who can say _895_ is enough
the executives were <unk> <unk> by the plunge even though it <unk> billions _896_ dollars off the value of their companies and millions off their personal fortunes
i 'm not going to worry about one day 's decline said kenneth <unk> digital _897_ corp. president who was <unk> <unk> through the bright orange and yellow leaves of the <unk> here after his company 's shares plunged $ N to close at $ N
_898_ did n't bother calling anybody i did n't even turn on tv
there has n't been any fundamental change in the economy _899_ john <unk> whose procter & gamble co. took an $ N slide to close at $ N
the fact that this happened two years _900_ and there was a recovery gives people some comfort that this wo n't be a problem
of course established corporate <unk> often tend to _901_ the setbacks of stock speculators and takeover artists
indeed one chief executive who was downright <unk> by friday 's events was robert crandall chairman of amr corp. the parent of american airlines and the target of _902_ takeover offer by mr. trump
asked whether friday 's action could help _903_ avoid being <unk> by the new york real estate <unk> mr. crandall <unk> broadly and said no comment
on friday morning before the market 's sell-off the business leaders issued a report predicting the economy would grow at roughly an inflation-adjusted N N annual _904_ through next year then accelerate <unk> in N
of the N economists who worked on the business council forecast only two projected periods of decline in the nation 's output over the next two years and in both <unk> the declines are too modest to warrant the phrase recession said lewis <unk> chairman of j.p. morgan & co. and vice chairman _905_ the business council
_906_ real estate slump that 's pushing down the price of new york office space and housing is also affecting the city 's retail real estate market
in manhattan <unk> store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been _907_ to fill
retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy turmoil in their own industries and a belief that <unk> have not yet _908_ bottom
there is an <unk> amount _909_ space available says faith <unk> senior vice president at <unk> associates store leasing inc
there _910_ about N stores for rent up from a more typical range of N to N
this further <unk> retailers _911_ says
they wonder should they sign a lease _912_ prices are still coming down
is this _913_ wrong time to open a store
who is _914_ to be in the space next door
in addition ms. <unk> says tenants _915_ can negotiate to pay <unk> that are about <unk> lower than <unk> ' initial asking price
a handful of hot retail locations _916_ as the <unk> street and madison and fifth avenue areas have been able to sustain what many see as <unk> <unk>
and in some neighborhoods <unk> have merely _917_ a <unk>
but _918_ average manhattan retail <unk> have dropped N N to N N in the past six months alone experts say
that follows a more <unk> decline in the _919_ six months after manhattan <unk> had run up rapidly since N
the same _920_ limiting demand for office space have affected retailing
as businesses contract or <unk> the number of employees _921_ might use retail services <unk> says edward a. <unk> senior vice president of helmsley <unk> inc
he says financial problems <unk> electronics fur and furniture companies key categories in the local retail _922_ have further <unk> the market
hardest hit are _923_ he calls secondary sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents
in these locations mr. <unk> says retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and <unk> have remained steady or in some _924_ have declined
weakness in the restaurant industry which is leaving retail space vacant <unk> _925_ problem for <unk>
it is also no comfort _926_ <unk> and small new york retailers when the future of larger department stores which <unk> retail neighborhoods are in doubt
hooker corp. parent of <unk> teller and b. altman 's is _927_ in bankruptcy proceedings and bloomingdale 's is for sale by its owner campeau corp
the trend _928_ lower <unk> may seem surprising given that some communities in new york are <unk> the loss of favorite local businesses to high <unk>
but despite the recent softening for many of these retailers there 's still been too big a jump from the rental _929_ of the late 1970s when their leases were signed
certainly the recent drop in _930_ does n't mean manhattan comes cheap
new york retail _931_ still run well above the going rate in other u.s. cities
madison and fifth _932_ and east <unk> street can command <unk> of up to $ N a square foot and $ N is not uncommon
_933_ thriving <unk> street area offers <unk> of about $ N a square foot as do <unk> locations along lower fifth avenue
by contrast <unk> in the best retail _934_ in boston san francisco and chicago rarely top $ N a square foot

when justice william <unk> marks the start of his <unk> year on the supreme court today the occasion will differ sharply _948_ previous <unk> of his tenure
for the first time the <unk> _949_ finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent rather than as a force in the high court 's majority
this role reversal _950_ true as well for his three liberal and moderate allies justices <unk> marshall harry <unk> and john stevens
but are these four players three of them in their <unk> ready to assume a different role after N years <unk> _951_ service on the high court
every _952_ is that the four are prepared to accept this new role and the <unk> that go with it but in different ways
justices <unk> and _953_ appear <unk> about it justices marshall and <unk> appear fighting mad
the four justices _954_ no newcomers to dissent often joining forces in the past decade to <unk> the court 's conservative <unk>
but always in years past they have <unk> the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to _955_ out a number of major victories in civil rights and <unk> cases
now however as the court 's new <unk> conservative majority continues to <unk> _956_ for the liberals are rare
_957_ change is most dramatic for justice <unk> the last <unk> of the <unk> liberal majority under chief justice <unk> warren
in the seven supreme court terms from the fall of N through the spring of N the <unk> of the warren court 's power justice <unk> cast only N _958_ votes in N cases decided by the court
last term _959_ he cast N <unk> votes in N decisions with the contentious <unk> ruling as his only big victory
but justice <unk> <unk> his new role strongly defending the importance of <unk> in a N _960_
each time the court _961_ an issue the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to <unk> the result he said
moreover in recent months he _962_ said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s he knew that the tables might turn in the future
he has said that he now knows how justice john <unk> felt a reference to the late conservative justice _963_ was the most frequent <unk> from the warren court 's opinions
associates of <unk> justice marshall say he was depressed about the court 's direction last spring but is <unk> about _964_ role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights
we could sweep it under the <unk> _965_ hide it but i 'm not going to do it he said in a speech last month
he like justice <unk> considers <unk> highly important for the future a _966_ that has n't escaped legal scholars
harvard law school _967_ laurence tribe says there is a <unk> flavor to current <unk>
the <unk> in the warren court he says appeared to be writing for the short-term _968_ that the court 's direction might change soon
<unk> and marshall are speaking in their <unk> to a more distant future _969_ says
justice <unk> who will turn N next month also seems <unk> about his _970_ role
associates say he takes some <unk> more personally than his colleagues especially attempts to _971_ the right to abortion first recognized in his N opinion roe vs. wade
friends and associates who saw justice <unk> _972_ the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years
and his outlook improved after successful <unk> surgery in august
but his level of frustration showed in a recent <unk> speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers _974_ chicago
he concluded his remarks by <unk> <unk> and at some length according to those present the late _975_ <unk> king 's famous i have a dream speech from the N march on washington
justice stevens N is probably the most <unk> of the <unk> about his role in part because he may be the least liberal of the four but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority _976_ than the others
if the role these four <unk> are assuming is a familiar one in modern supreme court history it also <unk> in an important way from recent history court _977_ say
the <unk> of the warren court were often defending a legal <unk> that they inherited says prof. <unk> dick howard of the university of virginia law school but the <unk> today are defending a <unk> that _978_ created
the government sold the deposits of four savings-and-loan institutions in its first wave of sales of big sick thrifts but low bids prevented _979_ sale of a fifth
the four s&ls were sold to large banks as was the case with most of the N previous transactions initiated by the resolution trust corp. since it was created in the s&l bailout _980_ two months ago
two of the four big thrifts were sold to ncnb corp. charlotte n.c. which has aggressively expanded its _981_ particularly in texas and florida
a canadian bank bought _982_ thrift in the first rtc transaction with a foreign bank
under these deals _983_ rtc sells just the deposits and the healthy assets
these <unk> transactions leave the bulk of bad assets mostly real estate with the government _984_ be sold later
in these four for instance the _985_ is stuck with $ N billion in bad assets
<unk> paid premiums ranging from N N to N N for the deposits and branch _986_ roughly in line with what analysts were expecting
the buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for _987_ two weeks as has been the case with previous deals
after that the buyers may <unk> the rates paid by _988_ former thrifts
but _989_ 's uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps
ncnb for example has been _990_ of the highest rate <unk> in the texas market and in florida rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities
the rtc had previously targeted five thrifts for _991_ sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines but the delays illustrate the tough <unk> facing the agency
these thrifts are <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> _992_ industry consultant based in <unk> va
for example the delay in selling people 's heritage savings <unk> kan. with $ N billion in assets has forced the rtc to consider selling off the thrift <unk> instead _993_ as a whole institution
ncnb continued its <unk> into the florida and _994_ markets
ncnb will _995_ university federal savings association houston which had assets of $ N billion
ncnb _996_ national bank will pay the rtc a premium of $ N million for $ N billion in deposits
as a measure of the <unk> to which the texas real _997_ market has <unk> the rtc will pay $ N billion to ncnb to take $ N million of bad assets
ncnb also acquired freedom savings & loan association tampa fla. which had _998_ assets of $ N million
ncnb will pay the rtc a premium of $ N _999_ for $ N billion in deposits
ncnb will also _1000_ $ N million of freedom 's assets from the rtc which will require $ N million in assistance
meridian bancorp inc. reading pa. will acquire hill financial savings association red hill pa. which had $ N billion in assets

time magazine in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new _1014_ is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise <unk>
in an announcement to its staff last week executives _1015_ time warner inc. 's weekly magazine said time will dramatically <unk> its use of electronic <unk> such as telephones in television subscription drives cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by N to four million and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $ N to $ N
_1016_ a related development the <unk> for the fourth year in a row said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in N a full <unk> page in the magazine costs about $ N
however because the guaranteed circulation base is _1017_ lowered ad rates will be effectively N N higher per subscriber according to richard <unk> time associate publisher
time is following the course of some other <unk> magazines _1018_ in recent years have challenged the publishing <unk> that maintaining artificially high and expensive <unk> is the way to draw advertisers
in _1019_ years reader 's digest new york times co. 's mccall 's and most recently news corp. 's tv guide have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers
deep discounts in <unk> and offers of free <unk> <unk> and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the _1020_ world of magazine <unk>
but time _1021_ part of the more <unk> time warner wants to <unk> itself away from expensive <unk>
besides time _1022_ think selling a news magazine with a <unk> radio is <unk>
<unk> just give _1023_ the wrong image said mr. <unk>
that perception takes the focus _1024_ the magazine
time magazine executives predictably <unk> the circulation cut as a show of strength _1025_ actually a benefit to advertisers
what we are doing is <unk> out _1026_ readers who are only <unk> related to the magazine and do n't really read it said mr. <unk>
we _1027_ trying to create quality and involvement
however time executives used the same explanation when in _1028_ N the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from N million to N million
and time 's paid circulation according to audit bureau of <unk> dropped N N _1029_ N in the six months ended june N N
still time 's move is being received _1030_ once again
it 's <unk> _1031_ advertisers to know the reader will be paying more said michael <unk> national media director at bozell inc. ad agency
a few drops in circulation are _1032_ no consequence
it 's not a show of weakness they are improving the quality of circulation while <unk> their _1033_
mr. <unk> said the changes represent a new _1034_ in the magazine industry a magazine 's net revenue per subscriber or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away
the question is _1035_ much are we getting from each reader said mr. <unk>
time 's rivals <unk> washington post co. 's newsweek and u.s. news & world report are less <unk> on electronic <unk> and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases
both magazines are expected to announce their _1037_ rates and circulation levels for N within a month
when the news broke _1038_ an attempted coup in panama two weeks ago sen. christopher dodd called the state department for a briefing
they said follow <unk> he told _1039_
that shows how far ted turner 's cable news network has come since its birth nine years ago when it was _1040_ the <unk> of television news
it is bigger faster and more profitable than _1041_ news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks
its niche as the network of record during major crises draws elite audiences _1042_ the world
but for all its _1043_ <unk> has hit a <unk>
although <unk> <unk> when big news breaks it <unk> during periods of _1044_
<unk> executives worry that the network 's <unk> but <unk> news format may be getting <unk> and wo _1045_ keep viewers coming back as the alternatives <unk> for news and information on cable-tv
just the fact we 're on N hours is no longer <unk> says ed turner <unk> 's executive vice president _1046_ gathering and no <unk> to ted turner
you ca n't _1047_ on that
so <unk> a unit of atlanta-based _1048_ broadcasting system inc. is trying to <unk> itself as a primary channel or what people in the television industry call a top of mind network
tonight to kick off the effort <unk> will premiere its first prime-time <unk> in years an <unk> show at N _1049_ eastern time to air <unk> against the network <unk>
the show will be <unk> by bernard shaw and <unk> <unk> a <unk> former texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a _1050_ in television or journalism
the new show is perhaps the <unk> in _1051_ number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more <unk> signature programming with <unk> stars
to <unk> itself <unk> is also expanding international coverage and adding a second <unk> _1052_
it is paying higher salaries after years of <unk> to lure _1053_ keep experienced staffers
and it is <unk> on an expensive gamble to break major stories _1054_ a large <unk> team
the next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables says jon <unk> executive vice president of _1055_ news <unk> 's sister network
but _1056_ wo n't be easy
networks like other consumer products develop images in _1057_ ' minds that are n't easy to change
it also takes money that <unk> has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will _1058_ in specially to see
and the cable-tv operators <unk> 's distributors _1059_ part owners like things just the way they are
the <unk> bid is aimed at <unk> 's <unk> <unk> and what may happen to it as the _1060_ news market grows more competitive
already <unk> is facing stronger competition from financial news network inc. and general electric co. 's consumer news _1061_ business channel both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future
in addition many cable-tv systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced _1062_ local broadcast stations

its watchers are _1064_ the whole a <unk> group of <unk> <unk> and news <unk> who spend an average of just N minutes a day watching <unk> according to audience research
that 's less than one-third the time that viewers _1065_ the major broadcast networks
the brief attention viewers give <unk> could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data and advertising become _1066_ important to cable-tv channels
<unk> _1067_ <unk> habits have been <unk> by its format
_1068_ strategy in the past has been to serve as a tv wire service
it focused on building up its news bureaus around _1069_ world so as events took place it could go live <unk> and longer than other networks
it filled its daily schedule with <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but _1070_ shows <unk> little in content <unk> or look
now the push is on for <unk> shows
our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity says paul <unk> <unk> executive _1072_ president for programming

and it is exploring other original programs _1074_ to its larry king live and <unk> talk shows which executives hope will keep people <unk> in
then there 's the world today the prime-time <unk> featuring mr. _1075_ and ms. <unk>
until now <unk> has featured its hollywood <unk> show during _1076_ key evening period
but N N of the <unk> households that watch news do so between N p.m. and _1077_ p.m. the network discovered so <unk> wants in
mr. <unk> says the <unk> team will probably do _1078_ live interviews a day with most of the program at least for now appearing similar to <unk> 's other <unk>
some in the industry are _1079_
i _1080_ it hard to <unk> of people switching over to <unk> for what at least in the public 's mind is the same news says <unk> frank the former <unk> president of nbc news and <unk> of the <unk> report

<unk> _1084_ hope the <unk> created by such <unk> will generate excitement for its <unk> programs in the way N minutes did so well for cbs
that 's such a departure from the past that many _1085_ the industry are skeptical <unk> will follow through with its <unk> commitment especially after it sees the cost of producing <unk> pieces
they 've never shown any <unk> to spend money on production _1086_ michael <unk> a senior producer with <unk> <unk> who notes that <unk> is <unk> to his job

says mr. <unk> <unk> is my wire _1089_ they 're on top of everything
but to improve they 've really got to _1090_ the investment in people
in any case <unk> operators have reason to fear any <unk> with <unk> _1091_ format

the broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at imperial corp. whose spokesman said the company withdrew its _1103_ from the federal office of thrift supervision because of an informal notice that imperial 's thrift unit failed to meet community reinvestment act requirements

september 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still <unk> and the <unk> over interest rates caused by the _1177_ price data contributed to the stock market 's plunge friday
after falling for three consecutive months the producer price index for finished goods shot up N N last month the labor department _1178_ friday as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer
although the report which was released before the stock market opened did n't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the dow jones industrial average analysts said it did play a role _1179_ the market 's decline
analysts immediately viewed the price data the <unk> inflation news in months as evidence that the federal reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall _1180_ many investors had hoped
further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the fed from easing credit the commerce department reported friday that retail sales grew N N in september to $ N billion
that rise came on top of a N N gain in august and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the _1182_
i think the friday report combined with the actions of the fed weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy said robert <unk> chief economist at _1183_ trust co. in chicago
but economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by _1184_ new numbers
the overall N N increase is serious in itself but what _1185_ even worse is that excluding food and energy the producer price index still increased by N N said gordon <unk> an economist at the national association of manufacturers
but sung won <unk> chief economist at <unk> corp. in minneapolis blamed rising energy prices _1186_ the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the september jump
i would say this is not bad news _1187_ is a <unk> he said
the core rate is not really _1188_ of line
all year energy prices have <unk> the producer price index which measures changes in the _1189_ producers receive for goods
inflation <unk> has fallen back from its <unk> _1190_ last winter when a steep <unk> in world oil prices sent the index surging at double-digit annual rates
energy prices then plummeted through the summer causing the _1191_ to decline for three consecutive months
overall the index has climbed at a N N compound annual rate since _1192_ start of the year the labor department said
while far _1193_ <unk> than the pace at the beginning of the year that is still a <unk> rise than the N N increase for all of N
moreover this year 's good _1194_ news may have ended last month when energy prices <unk> up N N after plunging N N in august
some analysts expect oil prices _1195_ remain relatively stable in the months ahead leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain
analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index but _1196_ N N climb was higher than most anticipated
i _1197_ the <unk> in inflation is going to continue for a few months said john <unk> chief economist at bell <unk> <unk> a washington economic forecasting firm
he predicted that inflation will moderate next year saying that credit conditions are fairly tight _1198_
but <unk> van <unk> president of the national association of <unk> said that last month 's rise is n't as bad an <unk> _1199_ the N N figure suggests
if you examine the data carefully the increase is concentrated in _1200_ and motor vehicle prices rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods he explained
passenger car prices jumped N N in september after climbing N N in august and declining in _1201_ late spring and summer
many analysts said the september _1202_ was a one-time event coming as dealers introduced their N models
although all the _1203_ data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations car prices rose beyond the <unk> autumn increase
prices for capital equipment rose a hefty N N in september while prices for _1204_ electronic equipment fell N N
food prices declined N _1205_ after climbing N N in august
meanwhile the retail sales report showed that _1206_ sales rose N N in september to $ N billion
but at least part of the increase could _1207_ come from higher prices analysts said
sales at general merchandise stores rose N N after declining N _1208_ in august while sales of building materials fell N N after rising N N
producer prices for intermediate goods grew N N in september after dropping for three _1209_ months
prices for crude goods an array of raw materials jumped N N after declining _1210_ N in august and <unk> up N N in july

<unk> financial corp. said it expects _1212_ report a loss of at least $ N million to $ N million for the third quarter
in the year-earlier period <unk> had _1213_ income of $ N but no per-share earnings
<unk> 's president and chief executive officer john <unk> said the loss stems from _1214_ factors
he said nonperforming assets rose to slightly more than $ N million from $ _1215_ million between june and september
approximately N N of the total <unk> of nonperforming commercial real _1216_ assets
<unk> <unk> estimated that it will provide between $ N million and $ N million _1217_ credit losses in the third quarter
<unk> added that significant additional loan-loss provisions may be required _1218_ federal regulators as part of the current annual examination of city federal savings bank <unk> 's primary subsidiary based in <unk> n.j
city federal operates N banking _1219_ in new jersey and florida
mr. <unk> said <unk> will also mark its portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions <unk> _1220_ of such bonds
that action <unk> said will result in a charge _1221_ third-quarter results of approximately $ N million
<unk> also said it expects to shed its remaining mortgage loan <unk> operations outside its principal _1222_ in new jersey and florida and as a result is taking a charge for discontinued operations
all these actions _1223_ <unk> said will result in a loss of $ N million to $ N million for the third quarter
he _1224_ however depending on the resolution of certain accounting issues relating to mortgages <unk> and the outcome of the annual examination of city federal currently in progress with respect to the appropriate level of loan loss reserves the total loss for the quarter could significantly exceed this range
centrust savings bank said federal thrift regulators ordered it _1225_ suspend dividend payments on its two classes of preferred stock indicating that regulators ' concerns about the troubled institution have heightened
in a _1226_ miami-based centrust said the regulators cited the thrift 's operating losses and apparent losses in its junk-bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends
_1227_ also ordered centrust to stop buying back the preferred stock
david l. paul chairman and chief executive officer criticized the federal office of thrift supervision which issued the <unk> saying it was inappropriate and based on _1228_ reasons
he said the thrift will try to _1229_ regulators to reverse the decision
the suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious _1230_ that signals that regulators have deep concerns about an institution 's health
in march regulators labeled centrust a troubled institution largely _1231_ of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses
in the same month the office of thrift supervision _1232_ the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track
for the nine months ended june N centrust had a net loss of $ N million _1233_ with year-earlier net income of $ N million
centrust which is florida 's largest thrift holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any _1234_ in the nation
since april it has <unk> its high-yield bond holdings to about $ N million from $ N billion
mr. paul said only about $ N million of the current holdings are <unk> securities registered with the securities and exchange _1236_
the remainder he said are commercial loan <unk> _1237_ private <unk> that are n't filed with the sec and do n't have a ready market
centrust and regulators _1238_ been in a dispute over market <unk> for the junk bonds
the office of thrift supervision has been <unk> centrust to provide current market values for _1239_ holdings but centrust has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative <unk> of the bonds and lack of a ready market
regulators have become increasingly <unk> about centrust 's and other _1240_ ' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market
the legislation requires thrifts to _1241_ themselves of junk bonds in the new <unk> regulatory climate
in american stock exchange composite trading friday centrust common shares closed at $ _1242_ down N cents
in a statement friday mr. paul challenged the regulators _1243_ decision saying the thrift 's operating losses and apparent junk-bond losses have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank
he also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds
in the _1245_ quarter for instance centrust added $ N million to its general reserves
mr. paul said the regulators should instead move ahead with <unk> centrust 's _1246_ to sell N of its N branches to great western bank a unit of great western financial corp. based in beverly hills calif
the branch sale is the centerpiece of centrust 's strategy to transform _1247_ into a traditional s&l from a <unk> institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits according to mr. paul
most _1248_ and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction which was announced in july long before now
many interpret the delay as an indication that regulators are _1249_ about the proposal
branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an _1250_
centrust however <unk> the branch sale saying it would bring in $ N million and reduce the thrift 's assets to $ N billion from _1251_ N billion
it said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $ N million or about N N of assets _1252_ a negative $ N million as of sept. N thus bringing centrust close to regulatory standards
centrust _1253_ the branch sale would also reduce the company 's large amount of good will by about $ N million
critics however say the branch sale will make centrust more dependent than _1254_ on <unk> deposits and junk bonds
mr. paul <unk> that he intends to further <unk> the size of centrust by not renewing more than $ N billion _1255_ <unk> certificates of deposit when they come due
the thrift is also working to unload its junk-bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds and it plans to eventually place some of _1256_ in a separate affiliate as required under the new thrift law
on a recent saturday night in the midst of west germany 's most popular prime-time show a <unk> bet the host that she could name any of N different _1257_ after just one <unk> while <unk>

but perhaps even more remarkable the <unk> <unk> <unk> make a bet regularly wins the top <unk> in the country 's tv ratings _1259_ drawing as many as N N of west german households
as the N economic integration approaches europe 's cultural <unk> have taken to the <unk> against american cultural <unk> threatening to impose quotas against such _1260_ <unk> as dallas miami vice and l.a. law
_1261_ much of what the europeans want to protect seems every bit as <unk> as what they are trying to keep out
the most <unk> opposition _1262_ american tv imports has come from french television and movie producers who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full N N of europe 's tv shows be produced in europe
so far the french have failed to win enough broad-based support to prevail
a <unk> through the television listings and _1264_ few <unk> of the european television dial suggest one reason why
while there are some popular action and drama series few <unk> _1265_ high culture and <unk> production values one might expect
more european air time is filled with <unk> game shows variety hours movies and talk shows many of which are _1266_ <unk> of their american counterparts
one of france 's most popular saturday night programs features <unk> seeking out their <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>
a _1268_ game show has as its host a belgian <unk> to be italian
one of italy 's favorite shows <unk> a <unk> variety show is so popular that viewers <unk> to buy a <unk> product <unk> <unk> whose <unk> were sung each week by <unk> <unk> even though the product did n't exist
<unk> the <unk> <unk> on another typical evening of fun on <unk> <unk> a <unk> won a bet with the show 's host thomas <unk> _1270_ he could identify N german <unk> over the telephone
a celebrity guest u.s. ambassador to west germany richard burt also won a bet that someone _1271_ pile up $ N worth of quarters on a <unk> coin
mr. burt _1272_ paid the penalty as if he had lost agreeing to spend a day with west german foreign minister <unk> <unk> <unk> and selling their combined weight in potato <unk>
if this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the <unk> barriers it may be because these shows need all _1273_ protection they can get
european programs usually _1274_ only their own local audience and often only a small portion of that
<unk> in germany or italy rarely make it even to france or great britain and almost never show up on u.s. _1275_
attempts to produce <unk> programs _1276_ generally resulted in disappointment
one _1277_ <unk> the <unk> <unk> song contest featuring <unk> <unk> from each of N european countries has been described as the world 's most boring tv show
another <unk> <unk> <unk> where _1278_ from <unk> european countries make <unk> of themselves performing <unk> tasks is a hit in france
a <unk> <unk> under the title almost anything goes <unk> _1279_
for the most part what 's made here stays here and for good _1280_
the <unk> of the british crop the literary <unk> that are shown on u.s. public television as <unk> theater make up a relatively _1281_ part of british air time
most british programming is more of an _1282_ taste
there _1283_ for instance one man and his dog a <unk> contest among sheep dogs
also <unk> to the british are hours of _1284_ <unk> even more hours of lawn bowling <unk> and still more hours of <unk> <unk>
european drama has had better though still mixed _1285_
the most popular such shows focus _1286_ narrow national concerns
a french <unk> of dallas called <unk> _1287_ set in a french <unk> had a good run in france which ended after the female lead was injured in a <unk> auto accident
<unk> black forest clinic a kind of german <unk> elsewhere set in a health <unk> is popular in _1288_ and has spread into france
_1289_ 's most popular series is a drama called la <unk> or the <unk> which <unk> the fight of an <unk> young investigator in <unk> against the mafia
it was <unk> news in italy _1290_ this year when the <unk> inspector was <unk> down in the series
spain 's _1291_ popular <unk> this year was <unk> the story of an aging <unk>
the trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular with american programs second says brian <unk> a former _1292_ of programs for the british broadcasting corp
_1293_ a choice everybody will watch a <unk> show
but frequently _1294_ is n't much choice
thus europe has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy _1295_ of its own programs with broader appeal
we _1296_ basically got to start from <unk> to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see concedes <unk> young head of britain 's national film theatre school
while some in the u.s. contend that advertising is the _1297_ of television here many believe that its absence is to blame for the european tv industry 's sluggish development
until recently national governments in _1298_ controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising
since production costs were guaranteed it did n't matter that _1299_ program could n't be sold abroad or put into <unk> as most american programs are
but not much money was spent on the shows either a situation that encouraged <unk> talk and game shows while discouraging <unk> <unk>
now however commercial channels are coming to most european countries and at the same time satellite and cable technology is _1301_ rapidly
just last _1302_ greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time spain earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels
the result is a new and huge appetite for programming
but perhaps to the <unk> of _1304_ calling for quotas most of this <unk> is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most <unk> programming now available reruns usually of shows made in the u.s.

the venture would strengthen the rapidly growing _1313_ between the two companies and help make them a leading force in european defense contracting
in recent months _1314_ string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have <unk> the <unk> world of european arms manufacture
already british aerospace and french <unk> <unk> <unk> on a british missile contract and on an <unk> control radar system
just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy ferranti international signal plc a smaller british defense _1316_ rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a u.s. unit
the sudden <unk> of british aerospace and _1317_ traditionally bitter competitors for middle east and third world weapons contracts is <unk> controversy in western europe 's defense industry
most threatened by closer british <unk> ties would be their respective _1318_ rivals including <unk> s.a. in france and britain 's general electric co. plc
but neither <unk> nor <unk> unrelated to stamford <unk> general electric co. are sitting quietly by as their _1319_ join forces
yesterday a source close to <unk> confirmed that his company _1320_ join the ferranti fight as part of a possible consortium that would bid against british aerospace and <unk>
companies with which <unk> has had talks about a possible joint ferranti bid include <unk> britain 's <unk> group plc west germany 's daimler-benz ag and france _1321_ dassault group
but it may be weeks before <unk> and its potential partners decide _1322_ to bid the source indicated
<unk> plans first to study ferranti 's financial accounts which auditors recently said included # N million in <unk> contracts at a u.s. unit _1323_ signal & control group with which ferranti merged last year
also any <unk> bid might be blocked by british antitrust regulators ferranti is <unk> 's main competitor on several key <unk> contracts and its purchase by <unk> may <unk> _1324_ defense ministry worries about concentration in the country 's defense industry
a consortium bid however would <unk> <unk> 's direct role in ferranti and might consequently _1325_ ministry officials
a _1326_ aerospace spokeswoman appeared <unk> by the prospect of a fight with <unk> for ferranti competition is the name of the game she said
at least _1327_ potential <unk> partner <unk> insists it is n't interested in ferranti
we have nothing _1328_ say about this affair which does n't concern us a <unk> official said sunday
the missile venture the british aerospace spokeswoman said is a needed response to the _1329_ environment in defense contracting
for both thomson and british aerospace earnings in their home markets _1330_ come under pressure from increasingly <unk> defense ministries and middle east sales a traditional mainstay for both companies ' exports have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices
the venture 's _1331_ for thomson is great
thomson feels the _1332_ of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other europeans
the european defense industry is consolidating for instance west germany 's siemens ag recently joined <unk> in a takeover of britain 's <unk> co. and daimler-benz agreed to _1333_ <unk> <unk> g.m.b <unk>
_1334_ missiles thomson is already <unk> by british aerospace and by its home rival france 's <unk> s.a. to better compete thomson officials say they need a partnership
to justify N ownership of the planned venture thomson would make a cash _1335_ to british aerospace
annual revenue of british aerospace 's missile business is about # _1336_ million a thomson spokesman said
british aerospace 's chief missile products include its <unk> family of <unk> <unk> _1337_
thomson missile products _1338_ about half british aerospace 's annual revenue include the <unk> <unk> missile family
<unk> _1339_ line co. said it will delay a proposed <unk> N million <unk> us$ N million expansion of its system because canada 's output of crude oil is shrinking
<unk> canada 's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major <unk> of crude to the u.s. said revised industry forecasts indicate that canadian oil output will total about N million barrels a day by N _1340_ N lower than a previous estimate
canadian crude production averaged about N million barrels a day during N 's first half about N N _1341_ the N level
the capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping and oil exploration activity is _1342_ down dramatically as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas said ronald <unk> vice president for government and industry relations with <unk> 's parent <unk> energy inc
mr. <unk> said _1343_ on <unk> 's system is down about N N since january and is expected to fall further making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s
there has been a swing of the <unk> back to the gas side _1344_ said
many of canada 's oil and _1345_ producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil and have shifted their exploration and development budgets <unk>
the number of active drilling <unk> in canada is down N N from a year ago and the number of completed oil wells is down more than that due to the increasing focus on gas exploration said robert <unk> manager of crude oil with calgary 's independent petroleum association _1346_ canada an industry group
mr. <unk> said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature conventional fields in western _1347_
<unk> <unk> about N N _1348_ all crude produced in western canada and almost N N of <unk> 's total volume consists of light crude
nearly all of the crude oil that canada exports to the u.s. is <unk> on <unk> 's system whose main line runs from <unk> to major u.s. and canadian cities in the great <unk> region including chicago <unk> toronto _1349_ montreal
canada 's current oil exports to the u.s. total about N barrels a day or about N N of net u.s. crude imports said john <unk> president of _1350_ new york-based petroleum industry research foundation
that ranks canada as the <unk> source of imported crude behind saudi _1351_ <unk> and mexico
mr. <unk> _1352_ canada 's declining crude output combined with the <unk> output of u.s. crude will help intensify u.s. reliance on oil from overseas particularly the middle east
it 's very much _1353_ growing concern
_1354_ when something is inevitable you learn to live with it he said
mr. <unk> _1355_ that the delay of <unk> 's proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase u.s. <unk> on offshore crude however since canadian imports are limited in any case by canada 's falling output
under terms of its proposed <unk> expansion which would _1356_ required regulatory approval <unk> intended to add N barrels a day of additional capacity to its system beginning with a modest expansion by N
_1357_ system currently has a capacity of N million barrels a day
inland steel industries inc. expects to report that third-quarter earnings dropped more than N N from the previous quarter as a result of reduced sales _1358_ and increased costs
in _1359_ second quarter the steelmaker had net income of $ N million or $ N a share including a pretax charge of $ N million related to the settlement of a suit on sales of $ N billion
the company said normal seasonal softness and lost orders caused by prolonged labor talks reduced shipments by N tons in the latest _1360_ compared with the second quarter
at the same time the <unk> business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses as well as higher labor costs _1361_ its new contract
the <unk> business was hurt by reduced margins and start-up costs associated with its joseph t. <unk> & son unit
the company said it is beginning to see some <unk> _1363_ in both the <unk> and <unk> segments which should result in improved results for the fourth quarter
_1364_ said its third-quarter results will be announced later this week
in the year-earlier third quarter when _1365_ industry was in the midst of a boom the company had net of $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion
predicting the financial results of _1366_ firms has been a tough job lately
take microsoft corp. the largest maker of personal computer software and generally _1367_ an industry bellwether
in july the company stunned wall street with the prediction _1368_ growth in the personal computer business overall would be only N N in N a modest increase when compared with the <unk> expansion of years past
_1369_ taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the <unk> reacted by selling the company 's stock which lost $ N that day to close at $ N in national over-the-counter trading
but that was all of _1370_ months ago
last week microsoft said _1371_ expects revenue for its first quarter ended sept. N to increase N N
the announcement caused the company 's stock to surge $ N _1372_ close at $ N a share
microsoft 's surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for <unk> about the financial _1373_ of the computer firms
_1374_ 's hard to know what to expect at this point said peter rogers an analyst at robertson <unk> & co
_1375_ industry <unk> <unk>
to illustrate mr. rogers said that of the N <unk> firms he follows half will report for their most recent _1376_ earnings below last year 's results and half above those results
among those companies expected to have a down quarter are _1377_ co. <unk> corp. and sun microsystems inc. generally solid performers in the past
international _1378_ machines corp. also is expected to report disappointing results
apple _1379_ inc. meanwhile is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended <unk>
another <unk> message _1380_ from businessland inc. a computer retailer
in july the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from apple and ibm had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended june N to $ N million or N cents _1381_ share
this month however businessland warned investors that results for its first quarter ended sept. N had n't met _1382_
the company said it expects earnings of N to N cents a share _1383_ from N cents a share in the year-earlier period
while the earnings picture <unk> observers say the major forces expected to shape the _1384_ in the coming year are <unk>
companies _1385_ continue to war over standards
in computer publishing a battle over <unk> _1386_ hurting adobe systems inc. which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays
until recently adobe had a lock on the market for image software but last month apple adobe 's _1387_ customer and microsoft <unk>
now the two firms are <unk> on an alternative to adobe 's approach _1388_ analysts say they are likely to carry ibm the biggest seller of personal computers along with them
_1389_ short-term outlook for adobe 's business however appears strong
the company is beginning to ship _1390_ new software program that 's being <unk> as a <unk> for owners of <unk> printers sold by apple
the program is aimed at improving the quality of printed _1391_
john <unk> adobe 's chief executive officer _1392_ the mountain view calif. company has been receiving N calls a day about the product since it was demonstrated at a computer publishing conference several weeks ago
meanwhile competition between various operating systems which control _1393_ basic functions of a computer <unk> trouble for software firms generally
it creates uncertainty and usually <unk> down sales said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> _1394_ group
mr. <unk> said this probably is behind the expected weak performance of <unk> corp. maker of a widely _1395_ computer publishing program
he expects <unk> to report earnings of N cents a share on revenues of $ N million for its third quarter compared with earnings of N cents a _1396_ on revenue of N million in the year-earlier period
_1397_ officials could n't be reached for comment
on the other hand the battle of the _1398_ is expected to grow increasingly irrelevant
a bus is the data _1399_ within a computer
ibm is backing one type of bus called <unk> while the nine other _1400_ computer makers including <unk> and compaq computer corp. have chosen another method
_1401_ do n't care about the bus said daniel benton an analyst at goldman sachs & co
he said apple 's family of <unk> computers for instance uses _1402_ different buses and no one seems to mind
the gap between winners and <unk> will grow
in personal computers apple compaq and ibm are expected to _1404_ their hold on their business
at the same time <unk> firms will _1405_ to lose ground
some lagging competitors _1406_ may leave the personal computer business altogether
<unk> technology for instance _1407_ considered a candidate to sell its troubled operation
<unk> has done well establishing a distribution business but they have _1408_ delivered products that sell said <unk> brown an analyst at prudential-bache securities
mr. brown estimates <unk> whose terminals business is strong will _1409_ a loss of N cents a share for its quarter ended <unk>
personal-computer makers _1410_ continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms
<unk> powerful <unk> computers designed with one or more microprocessors as their brains are expected to _1411_ take on functions carried out by more expensive minicomputers and mainframes
the guys that make traditional hardware are really being <unk> by <unk> _1412_ said mr. benton
as a result of this trend longtime <unk> <unk> ibm and digital equipment corp. are scrambling to <unk> with <unk> systems of their own
but they will have to act quickly
mr. benton expects compaq to unveil a family of high-end personal computers _1415_ this year that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of <unk> machines
a <unk> of new computer companies also has targeted this <unk> _1416_
population drain ends for midwestern _1417_
iowa is _1418_ a comeback
so are _1419_ ohio and michigan
the population _1420_ all four states is on the <unk> according to new census bureau estimates following declines throughout the early 1980s
_1421_ gains to be sure are rather small
iowa for instance saw its population grow by N people or N N between N and N _1422_ census bureau says
still even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n't _1423_ at all since N
between N and N north <unk> was the only state in the midwest to lose _1424_ a loss of N people
six of the N midwestern _1425_ have been growing steadily since N illinois kansas minnesota missouri south <unk> and wisconsin
the _1426_ has been holding its own in the population race
seven of nine states have grown each year _1427_ N including new york which lost N N of its population during the 1970s
and although pennsylvania and massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade they _1428_ growing again
at the same time several states in the south and west _1429_ had their own population turnaround
seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population west virginia mississippi louisiana _1430_ <unk> wyoming and alaska
overall though the south and west still <unk> the northeast and midwest and fast-growing states like florida and california ensure that the pattern will _1431_
but the growth _1432_ between the sun belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing
more elderly maintain their independence
_1434_ to modern medicine more couples are growing old together
and even after losing _1435_ spouse more of the elderly are staying independent
a new census bureau study of _1436_ <unk> population shows that N N of people aged N to N were living with a spouse in N up from N N in N
this does n't mean they 're less _1437_ to live alone however
that share has remained at about N N since N
what has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other <unk> _1439_ as children
in N N N of those aged N to N lived _1440_ <unk> other than spouses down from N N in N
as people _1441_ even older many become <unk>
but even among those aged N and older the share _1442_ with a spouse rose slightly to N N in N from N N in N
like their younger counterparts the older elderly are less likely to live with other <unk>
only N N of those aged N and older lived with <unk> other than spouses in N down _1444_ N N in N
the likelihood of living alone beyond the age of N has increased _1445_ N N from N N
more people are remaining _1446_ longer presumably because they are better off <unk> and financially
careers count _1447_ for the <unk>
many affluent people place personal success _1448_ money above family
at least that 's what a survey by ernst & young and <unk> <unk> <unk> indicates
two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs while fewer _1450_ half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families
being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this _1451_
_1452_ most studies of the affluent market this survey excluded the <unk>
average household income for the sample was $ N _1453_ average net assets were reported as $ N
the goal was to learn about one of today 's fastest-growing income groups the <unk> class
although they represent only N N of the population they control _1455_ one-third of discretionary income
across the _1456_ these consumers value quality buy what they like rather than just what they need and appreciate products that are distinctive
despite their considerable incomes and assets N N of the _1457_ in the study do n't feel financially secure and <unk> do n't feel that they have made it
<unk> percent do n't even feel they are financially _1458_ off
many of the affluent are n't comfortable _1459_ themselves either
about N N do n't feel they 're more able than others
while <unk> feel some <unk> about being _1461_ only N N give $ N or more to charity each year
<unk> percent attend _1462_ services regularly at the same time N N feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one 's principles

more than N years ago prof. harold hill _1474_ con man in meredith <unk> 's the music man warned the citizens of river city iowa against the game
now <unk> spirits on <unk> 's town _1475_ have barred the town 's <unk> hotel the grand <unk> from <unk> three free pool tables in its new <unk>
mayor lynn <unk> and two members of the council _1476_ they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool halls along <unk> 's main street
_1477_ the mayor in an <unk> that bears a <unk> <unk> to prof. hill 's warned that alcohol leads to betting which leads to fights
the council 's action is yet another blow _1478_ a sport that its fans claim has been <unk> <unk> for years
obviously _1479_ 're not in touch with what 's going on says tom <unk> vice president of the national <unk> <unk> association
pool is hot in new york _1480_ chicago he insists where upscale <unk> places are adding tables
with today 's tougher drunk driving laws he adds people _1481_ n't want to just sit around and drink
_1482_ <unk> behavior seems unlikely at the grand <unk> where rooms average $ N a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for $ N a pop
_1483_ the <unk> manager elizabeth <unk> wo n't admit <unk> in jeans <unk> or tennis shoes
but a majority of _1484_ <unk> council did n't buy those arguments
introducing pool argued <unk> <unk> _1485_ would be dangerous
it would open a _1486_ of <unk>

after its previous mayor committed <unk> last year an investigation disclosed that town officials regularly voted on their own projects gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into the town 's <unk> for trips _1488_ <unk>

of all the ethnic <unk> in america which is _1500_ most troublesome right now
a good bet would be the _1501_ between blacks and <unk> in new york city
or so it must seem _1502_ <unk> mason the veteran jewish <unk> appearing in a new abc <unk> airing on tuesday nights N p.m. edt
not _1503_ is mr. mason the star of chicken soup he 's also the <unk> of a <unk> tradition dating back to duck soup and he 's currently a man in hot water
here in neutral language is the <unk> of mr. mason 's remarks quoted first in the village voice while he was _1504_ paid spokesman for the rudolph giuliani mayoral campaign and then in newsweek after he and the campaign <unk> company
mr. mason said that many jewish voters feel guilty _1505_ blacks so they support black candidates <unk>
he said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination so they too support black _1506_ <unk>
he said that <unk> have contributed _1507_ to black causes over the years than vice <unk>
of _1508_ mr. mason did not use neutral language
as a <unk> of ethnic humor from the old days on the <unk> belt _1509_ television and the <unk> circuit mr. mason <unk> reached for the <unk>
he said <unk> were sick with _1510_ and he called david dinkins mr. giuliani 's black opponent a fancy <unk> with a <unk>
if mr. mason had used less <unk> language to <unk> his <unk> analysis of the voting behavior of his _1511_ new <unk> would the water be quite so hot
it probably would because few or none of the people upset by mr. mason 's remarks _1512_ bothered to <unk> between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used <unk> language
in addition some of mr. mason 's critics have implied that his _1513_ of ethnic humor is itself a form of <unk>
for example the new york _1514_ counsel for the <unk> said that mr. mason is like a <unk>
people _1515_ fast leaving the place where he is stuck
these critics fail to <unk> between the type of ethnic humor that _1516_ at <unk> another group such as polish jokes and the type that is <unk> aiming <unk> as well as <unk>
the latter typically is the humor of the <unk> and it was <unk> by both blacks and <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> _1517_ as a means of <unk> their white and <unk> audiences along with themselves
in the hands of a _1518_ like <unk> bruce this <unk> <unk> could cut both the <unk> and the audience to <unk>
but <unk> by a pro like <unk> mason it _1519_ a <unk> form of <unk>
_1520_ <unk>
_1521_ despite all the media <unk> about comedy and politics not <unk> they are similar in one respect both can serve as <unk> for easing <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of groups in conflict
that 's why it 's dangerous to _1522_ <unk> thought police on college <unk> and elsewhere <unk> all critical mention of group differences
as elizabeth <unk> wrote in the _1523_ york times just before the mason <unk> perhaps <unk> would not <unk> over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to <unk>
the question is if _1524_ conflicts still exist as <unk> they do and if mr. mason 's type of ethnic humor is <unk> then what other means do we have for letting off steam
do n't say the tv <unk> because that happens to be a <unk> that in its desperate need to attract everybody and <unk> nobody resembles politics more _1525_ it does comedy
it is true that the best <unk> do allow group differences to <unk> <unk> vs. blue-collar <unk> in <unk> children vs. adults in the cosby show
but these are not the differences that make _1527_
in chicken soup mr. mason plays <unk> a jewish _1528_ <unk> <unk> lynn <unk> an irish widow and mother of three against the wishes of his mother <unk> <unk> and her brother michael <unk> <unk>
it 's worth noting that both <unk> <unk> are <unk>
at least they both speak with strong <unk> as do <unk> _1530_ <unk>
it could n't be more obvious that chicken soup is being made _1531_ an old <unk>
and a safe one imagine if the <unk> in question were between an _1532_ <unk> and a member of the nation of <unk>
back in the 1920s the play and movie versions of <unk> 's irish rose made the theme of <unk> between the <unk> <unk> of jewish and irish <unk> so popular that its author anne <unk> _1533_ a <unk> suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public <unk>
and it has remained there as <unk> by its <unk> in a N cbs <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> _1534_ sole <unk> was that it led to the <unk> marriage of meredith <unk> and david <unk>
clearly _1535_ question with chicken soup is not whether the pot will <unk> over but whether it will <unk> at all
_1536_ far the <unk> have been few and far between
part of the problem is the _1537_ of all <unk> ever since the <unk> days of norman <unk> to <unk> about social issues
to some extent this tendency emerges whenever the show tries _1538_ <unk> us about ethnic <unk> by <unk> them
for instance michael <unk> <unk> not because he 's a <unk> jewish businessman but because he <unk> his <unk> _1539_ as a salesman in order to become a social worker
even more <unk> is the <unk> between <unk> <unk> and mr. _1540_ 's comic <unk>
the best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end and occasionally in the middle when mr. mason <unk> into his _1541_ mode and starts <unk> out that old-fashioned jewish <unk> to other people as well as to himself
but too often these <unk> lack spark because this <unk> like all <unk> is <unk> about _1542_ mr. mason 's stock in trade ethnic differences
i 'm not suggesting that the _1543_ start putting together episodes about topics like the <unk> dispute over the <unk> <unk> at <unk>
that issue _1544_ racial <unk> in new york city will have to cool down not heat up before it can <unk>
but i am suggesting that they stop requiring mr. mason to <unk> his classic <unk> with some line about <unk> for other people that would sound <unk> on the <unk> _1545_ miss america
at your age <unk> you ought to know that _1546_ ca n't make soup without turning up the <unk>
the _1547_ white house reaction to a plunge in stock prices has a <unk> history of calm right up through friday
treasury _1548_ nicholas brady said in a statement friday that the stock-market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy
the economy he added remains <unk> and the outlook _1549_ for continued moderate growth

there is nothing wrong with _1552_ economy all the <unk> are up

the senate 's decision to approve a <unk> deficit-reduction bill _1559_ a capital-gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of <unk> a gains tax reduction this year
late friday night the senate voted N to approve an estimated _1560_ N billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened rather than narrowed the federal budget deficit
lawmakers drastically <unk> the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax _1561_ and spending increases
_1562_ 're putting a deficit-reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit-reduction bill said senate budget committee chairman james <unk> d. <unk>
but senate supporters of the <unk> legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through congress that could carry some of the measures that _1563_ been cast aside including a capital-gains tax cut
in addition the companion _1564_ bill already passed by the house includes a capital-gains provision
house-senate negotiations are _1565_ to begin at <unk> and last for a while
no one can predict exactly what will happen _1566_ the house side said senate minority leader robert dole r. <unk>
but he added i believe republicans and democrats will work together to get capital-gains reform this _1567_
white house budget director richard darman told reporters yesterday that _1568_ administration would n't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill
we do n't need this as _1569_ way to get capital gains he said
house budget committee chairman leon <unk> d. calif said in an interview if that _1570_ the signal that comes from the white house that will help a great deal
the senate 's decision was a setback _1571_ president bush and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year
opponents of the cut are playing _1572_
senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine said he was confident that any house-senate agreement on _1573_ deficit-reduction legislation would n't include a capital-gains tax cut
and a senior aide to the house ways and means committee where tax legislation <unk> said there _1574_ n't any plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year
one obvious place to <unk> a capital-gains tax cut and perhaps other popular items stripped from _1575_ deficit-reduction bill is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit
such legislation must be enacted by the end _1576_ the month
the senate bill _1577_ <unk> back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through congress
because the legislation has n't been completed president bush has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board _1578_ cuts mandated by the gramm-rudman deficit-reduction law
senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the house to agree _1579_ the <unk> bill
the house appears _1580_ to join the senators
a key is whether house republicans are willing to <unk> to their _1581_ colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions
although i am encouraged by the senate action said chairman dan <unk> _1582_ ill of the house ways and means committee it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the <unk> conference with the senate
another big question <unk> over the _1583_ is what president bush thinks
he has been <unk> a <unk> bill _1584_ a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut
but republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and <unk> the N votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor so they went _1585_ with the <unk> bill
the senate bill was stripped of many popular though <unk> provisions a number of which _1586_ included in the house-passed bill
these _1587_ a child-care initiative and <unk> of <unk> tax breaks for low-income housing and <unk> expenditures
also missing from the senate bill is the house 's repeal of a law called section N that _1588_ companies to give <unk> workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives
one <unk> provision that was originally in the senate bill but _1589_ cut out because it lost money was the proposal by chairman lloyd <unk> d. texas of the senate finance committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts
mr. <unk> said he hopes the _1590_ will consider that measure soon
to the <unk> of some doctors the bill dropped a plan passed _1591_ the finance committee that would have <unk> the entire <unk> system under medicare
to _1592_ <unk> of many low-income people efforts to boost medicaid funding especially in rural areas also were <unk>
asked why senators were giving up so much new mexico sen. pete <unk> the ranking republican on the senate budget committee said we _1593_ looking like <unk>
things had just gone _1594_ far
sen. dole said that the move required _1595_ by every senator
it worked others _1596_ because there were no exceptions all <unk> provisions were <unk>
the senate also dropped a _1597_ by its finance committee that would have increased the income <unk> beyond which senior citizens have their social security benefits reduced
in addition the bill _1598_ a plan to make permanent a N N <unk> tax on long-distance telephone calls
it no longer includes a plan that would have <unk> what remains of the <unk> method of accounting which is used _1599_ military contractors to reduce their tax burden
it also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay _1600_ benefits for current <unk>
also <unk> was a <unk> increase in the maximum <unk> safety and health _1601_ penalties which would have raised $ N million in fiscal N
a provision that _1602_ have made the social security administration an independent agency was <unk>
the approval of the senate bill was especially sweet for sen. mitchell who had _1603_ the streamlining
mr. mitchell 's relations with budget director darman who pushed for a capital-gains cut to be added to the measure have been <unk> since mr. darman chose to <unk> the maine democrat and deal with other lawmakers _1604_ this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal N supplemental spending bill
the deficit reduction bill contains $ N billion in tax increases in _1605_ N and $ N billion over five years
the _1606_ provisions which affect mostly corporations would
prevent companies that have made leveraged buy-outs from getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused by interest payments on _1607_ issued to finance the buy-outs effective aug. N N
require _1608_ funds to include in their taxable income dividends paid to them on the date that the dividends are declared rather than received effective the day after the tax bill is enacted
_1609_ a <unk> regarding employee stock ownership plans effective june N N that has been <unk> by investment bankers in corporate takeovers

increase to $ N a person from _1618_ N the international <unk> departure tax and impose a $ <unk> tax on international departures by commercial ships
the measure also includes spending cuts and increases in _1619_ fees
among _1620_ provisions
reduction of medicare spending in fiscal N by some $ N billion in part by curbing increases in _1621_ to physicians
the plan would impose a brief freeze on physician fees next year

in response to your overly optimistic <unk> piece on _1630_ long unemployment lasts people patterns sept. N i am in the communications field above entry level
i was laid _1631_ in august N and after a <unk> and <unk> job search was hired in august N
my unemployment insurance ran out before i found a job i found _1632_ and layoffs in many companies
the statistics quoted by the _1633_ census bureau report <unk> from N to N are out of date certainly as an average for the northeast and possibly for the rest of the country
i think what bothered me most about the piece was that there seemed to be an underlying attitude to tell your readers _1634_ is well if you 're getting laid off do n't worry and if you 're <unk> it 's a seller 's market
to top it off _1635_ <unk> the <unk> showing the average number of months in a job search as time off

looking for a job was one _1637_ the most anxious periods of my life and is for most people

moody 's investors service said it reduced its rating on $ N million of subordinated _1643_ of this beverly hills calif. thrift citing turmoil in the market for <unk> high-yield securities
the agency said it reduced its rating on the thrift 's subordinated debt to b-2 from <unk> and will keep the debt under review for possible further downgrade
columbia _1645_ is a major holder of so-called junk bonds
new federal legislation _1646_ that all thrifts <unk> themselves of such speculative securities over a period of years
columbia savings _1647_ were n't available for comment on the downgrade

moody 's investors service inc. said it downgraded its rating to b-2 from <unk> on less than _1649_ N million of this thrift 's senior subordinated notes
the rating concern said franklin 's troubled diversification record _1650_ the securities business was one reason for the downgrade citing the troubles at its <unk> rothschild subsidiary and the possible sale of other subsidiaries
they perhaps _1651_ concern that we were getting out of all these said franklin president <unk> h. hall
i think it was a little <unk> on _1652_ part
just when it seemed safe to go back into stocks wall street suffered another severe attack of _1653_
does this signal another black monday _1654_ coming
or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity just like oct. N N eventually turned out _1655_ be
here 's what several leading market experts and money managers say about _1656_ 's action what happens next and what investors should do
_1657_ <unk>
i 'm the only one who _1658_ there would be an october massacre all through late august and september says mr. <unk> once a widely followed market <unk> and still a well-known newsletter writer
everyone will tell you that this time is different from N he says
well in some ways it is different _1660_ technically it is just the same
if you 're _1661_ <unk> you <unk> the signals
right now they 're telling me to get the hell out and stay out
_1663_ see no major support until N
i _1664_ a possibility of going to N this month
mr. <unk> says he would n't even think of buying until at least N to N stocks have hit 52-week _1665_ about N stocks hit new lows friday
most people he says _1666_ no idea what a massacre pattern looks like
<unk> <unk>
a <unk> _1668_ with shearson lehman hutton inc. ms. <unk> had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the N crash
friday 's big drop she says was not a crash
this was an october massacre like those that occurred in _1670_ and N
now as in those two years her stock market indicators _1671_ positive
so she thinks the damage will be short-lived _1672_ contained
those <unk> lasted one to four weeks and took the market N N _1673_ she says
this is exactly the same thing as far as _1674_ 'm concerned
thus _1675_ says if the dow jones industrial average dropped below N it would just be a <unk>
my advice is to _1676_
as she <unk> it the average stock now sells for about N times companies _1677_ earnings
she says that ratio could climb to N _1678_ current interest rates and still be within the range of fair value
<unk> davis
friday 's fall marks the start _1680_ a bear market says mr. davis president of <unk> davis research inc
but mr. davis whose views are widely respected by money managers says he expects no <unk> crash
there was a unique combination _1682_ N he says
margin debt was at a record _1683_
there was _1684_ public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds
the main thing was portfolio insurance _1685_ mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses
a hundred billion dollars in stock _1686_ subject to it
in N such selling contributed to a _1687_ effect
today could _1688_ be an up day mr. davis says if major brokerage firms agree to <unk> from program trading
over the next several months though he says _1689_ look bad
_1690_ think the market will be heading down into november he says
we will probably have a year-end rally _1691_ then go down again
sort of a <unk> _1692_ market
_1693_ expects the downturn to carry the dow jones industrial average down to around N sometime next year
that would be _1694_ normal bear market he says
i guess that 's _1695_ forecast
leon _1696_ <unk>
i do n't think _1697_ market is going through another october <unk>
i do n't think that 's the case at all says mr. <unk> a partner at goldman sachs & co. and chairman of goldman sachs asset _1698_
mr. _1699_ sees this as a good time to pick up bargains but he does n't think there 's any need to rush
i expect the market to open weaker monday but then it should find some stability
he <unk> off several _1701_ differences between now and two years ago
unlike N interest rates have been falling this year
unlike _1703_ the dollar has been strong
and unlike N the economy does _1704_ appear to be in any danger of <unk>
but the economy 's slower _1705_ this year also means the outlook for corporate profits is n't good he says
so it 's a very mixed _1706_
_1707_ he concludes this is not a good environment to be fully invested in stocks
if i had come into friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios i would not do any _1708_
_1709_ we came into friday with a conservative portfolio so i would look to do some modest buying on behalf of clients
we 're going _1710_ look for some of the <unk> companies that got <unk> friday
john kenneth _1711_
this is the latest <unk> of the capacity of _1712_ financial community for <unk> <unk> says mr. <unk> an economist
i see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion he says
the explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has <unk> a lot of <unk> securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations _1714_ are the <unk> of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity
this has both made investors uneasy and the _1715_ more vulnerable
nevertheless he says a depression does _1716_ appear likely
there is more <unk> in the economy at _1717_ than we commonly <unk> he says
it takes _1718_ error now to have a major depression than back in the <unk> much as the financial community and the government may try
_1719_ <unk>
new york money manager mario <unk> an expert at <unk> takeover candidates says that _1720_ are n't totally gone
companies are still going _1721_ buy companies around the world he says
examples are ford looking at jaguar bellsouth _1722_ at lin broadcasting
these sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them so mr. <unk> figures _1723_ will continue
the market was up N N since president bush took office mr. <unk> says so a correction _1724_ to be expected
he thinks another crash is unlikely and says he was <unk> at selected _1725_ during friday 's plunge
stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity this week _1726_ guys like me he says
_1727_ rogers
it seems to me that this is the <unk> that has finally <unk> the balloon _1728_ mr. rogers a professor of finance at columbia university and former <unk> of one of the most successful hedge funds in history quantum fund
he sees _1729_ problems financial problems ahead for the u.s. with a fairly strong possibility of a recession
friday you could n't sell dollars he _1730_
dealers would give you a quote but then _1731_ to make the trade
if the dollar stays weak he says that will add _1732_ <unk> pressures in the u.s. and make it hard for the federal reserve board to ease interest rates very much
mr. rogers wo _1733_ decide what to do today until he sees how the london and tokyo markets go
he recommends that investors sell <unk> stocks but hang on to some other stocks especially utilities which often do well _1734_ periods of economic weakness
frank _1735_
_1736_ people now claim to have predicted the N crash
<unk> newsletter writer francis _1737_ <unk> actually did it he stated in writing in september N that the dow jones industrial average was likely to decline about N points the following month
mr. <unk> says what happens _1738_ will depend a good deal on the federal reserve board
if it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks _1739_ says that could quiet things down
if not we _1740_ go to N very soon
frank w. _1741_
stock prices would _1742_ have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks says mr. <unk> president and managing director of renaissance investment management inc. in cincinnati
renaissance which manages about $ N billion drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at _1743_ beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally
renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents primarily u.s. _1744_ bills
<unk> probably are the right place to be he _1745_
regarding the oct. N letter to the editor from rep. _1746_ <unk> chairman of the house subcommittee on employment and housing alleging
N that _1747_ sept. N editorial <unk> committees was <unk> inaccurate and deliberately misleading
i thought your editorial was <unk> accurate and _1748_ <unk>
N that mr. <unk> supported the rights of the witnesses to _1749_ the fifth amendment
yes he did
as i watched him on <unk> i heard him speak those lovely words about the bill of rights which he quotes from _1751_ <unk> of the hearings
he did repeat those nice <unk> several times as an indication of his support for the _1752_
he used about N words defending the witnesses ' _1753_ rights
unfortunately by my _1754_ guess he used better than N words <unk> <unk> on the witnesses for exercising the fifth
he <unk> his <unk> of constitutional meat between large <unk> of <unk> commentary
as your editorial <unk> pointed out samuel <unk> former hud secretary _1756_ <unk> wilson mr. <unk> 's former aide are currently being held up to <unk> for taking the fifth amendment
that certainly is not the supposed distorted reading indicated _1757_ mr. <unk>
N that his committee does not _1758_ with any possible criminal activity at hud
my colleagues and i fully realize we are not _1759_ court etc
<unk> _1760_
by any reasonable man <unk> mr. <unk> and his colleagues have a whole bunch _1761_ people tried and convicted
apparently their verdict _1762_ in
right now they 're pursuing _1763_
that 's not a bad _1764_ to proceed just somewhat different from standard american practice
how was that practice referred _1765_ when i was in school
<unk> yes _1766_ called a star chamber
of course mr. _1767_ <unk> protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change
_1768_ doubt that 's partially true
everything that mr. <unk> says in _1769_ letter is partially true
he 's right about his _1770_ 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior hud officials
but if his explanation _1771_ <unk> is true why is his investigation so <unk> as to identify criminal activity
why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and _1772_
such _1773_ what happened when congress wanted to know about $ N toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost
no mr. <unk> 's complaints simply wo _1774_ wash
N that the journal <unk> the <unk> fraud waste <unk> <unk> and abuse of the public that took place while _1775_ <unk> was secretary of hud etc. and so forth
no to my mind the journal did not defend <unk> fraud waste <unk> <unk> and abuse of _1776_ public trust
it defended appropriate constitutional <unk> and practical common _1777_
the problem which the journal so <unk> pointed out in a number of articles is not the likes of mr. <unk> who after all is really a bit player on the _1778_ but the attempt by congress to enhance itself into a <unk> body
of course we 've also got a judiciary that _1779_ the same objective
the system is the problem not _1780_ individual member
individuals can always have their hands <unk>
it 's when such <unk> does n't occur _1782_ we 've got trouble
i do not by _1783_ means defend hud management
but i think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater _1784_ to american <unk> of liberty and freedom than any <unk> and yes maybe <unk> within hud could possibly generate
the last time i saw a similar congressional hearing was when <unk> <unk> joe <unk> did his work
raymond _1786_
<unk> n.j
i disagree with the statement by mr. <unk> that one should not draw an adverse <unk> against former hud _1788_ who <unk> their fifth amendment privilege against <unk> in congressional hearings
the fifth amendment states in _1789_ part that no person shall be <unk> in any criminal case to be a witness against himself
this privilege against <unk> <unk> the drawing of an adverse <unk> against a _1790_ defendant who chooses not to testify
thus in a criminal case a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be <unk> _1791_ take the stand as a witness thus forcing him to take the fifth
the privilege however _1792_ been limited in <unk> with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only
the supreme court and some states have _1793_ recognized that the fifth amendment does not preclude the <unk> where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause
<unk> v. <unk> N u.s. _1794_ N
thus in a civil case a defendant may be called as _1795_ witness he may be forced to testify or take the fifth and his taking of the fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse <unk> against him in the civil matter
he may take the fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith _1796_ <unk> belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution
allowing the defendant to take the fifth in a _1797_ matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony <unk> him in the civil matter but because the testimony in the civil matter could be <unk> used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution
<unk> the risk _1798_ such prosecution a court may order the defendant to testify
thus when mr. <unk> asserted the fifth in _1799_ <unk> proceeding particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel one must conclude that he held a <unk> <unk> belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution
the subcommittee congress and the american public have every right to draw the adverse <unk> and to <unk> with mr. <unk> 's own belief that his testimony could help <unk> him of a crime
drawing the _1801_ <unk> in a <unk> congressional hearing does not <unk> the fifth amendment shield against <unk>

it was _1804_ the 13th and the stock market plummeted nearly N points
just _1805_ <unk>
_1806_ is <unk> fear of the number N justified
in <unk> a so-called friday the 13th _1807_ has been set up and shot down by different professors
robert <unk> and <unk> <unk> professors of finance _1808_ the university of miami found evidence that the market is spooked by friday the 13th
but their study which <unk> the N period has _1809_ been shown to be <unk> by an <unk> choice of data
in the _1810_ the market took falls nine times in a row on friday the <unk>
but the date tends to be a plus not a minus for stocks according to _1811_ <unk> a <unk> of stock market <unk>
another study found that the N <unk> the 13th in the N period had higher than average returns higher even than <unk> in general which tend to be strong days for stock prices
on the only other friday the 13th this year the dow jones industrial average _1813_ about four points
professor <unk> says the original study titled friday the 13th part <unk> was _1814_ <unk>
in a similar <unk> he adds that the anniversary of the N crash and saturday 's _1815_ moon could have played a part too in friday 's market activity
<unk> of those during the N crash that as stock prices plummeted _1816_ trading activity <unk> some phone calls to market makers in over-the-counter stocks went <unk>
we could n't get dealers to answer their phones said robert king senior vice _1817_ of otc trading at <unk> co. in atlanta
_1818_ was like the friday before black monday two years ago
whether <unk> phone calls _1819_ any effect or not nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on the new york and american exchanges
_1820_ the nasdaq composite index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever <unk> N or N N to N
ten points of _1821_ drop occurred during the last N minutes of trading
by comparison the _1822_ york stock exchange composite tumbled N N friday and the american stock exchange composite fell N N
_1823_ oct. N N the nasdaq composite fell N points or N N followed by its devastating <unk> or N N slide three days later
nasdaq volume friday totaled N million _1824_ which was only the fifth busiest day so far this year
the <unk> record of N million shares was set on oct. N
there was n't a lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved said <unk> <unk> <unk> _1826_ of <unk> <unk> <unk> a new york company that makes markets in thousands of otc issues
most of the complaints about <unk> phone calls came from regional brokers rather than _1827_ investors
mr. king of <unk> and others were quick to add that they believe the problem _1828_ more from traders ' inability to handle the volume of calls rather than a <unk> attempt to avoid making trades
the _1829_ is a <unk> one for nasdaq and its <unk> companies which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash
peter dapuzzo head of retail equity trading _1830_ shearson lehman hutton declared it was the last hour of trading on a friday
there were too many phones ringing and too many things happening _1831_ expect market makers to be as efficient as robots
it was _1832_ <unk> we were all busy
james <unk> head of otc trading at hambrecht & quist in san _1833_ said it was just like two years ago
everybody was trying to do the same thing at the same time
<unk> mullins the otc trading chief at dean witter reynolds in new york said <unk> that his company executed every order _1835_ received by the close of trading
but he _1836_ you can only take one call at a time
_1837_ makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur
on days like friday that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to
when selling is so <unk> prices fall <unk> and _1839_
two years ago faced with the possibility _1840_ heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories market makers themselves began <unk> shares <unk> the slide in otc stock prices
on friday some market makers were selling again traders said
but with profits sagging on wall _1842_ since the crash companies have kept smaller share <unk> on hand
mr. <unk> of hambrecht & quist said some prices fell without trades taking place as _1843_ makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares
_1844_ was hitting everyone else 's bid he said
so while otc companies incurred losses on friday trading officials said the damage _1845_ n't as bad as it was in N
two years ago we were _1846_ huge inventories and that was the big <unk>
i do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now said mr. king of _1847_
tony <unk> head of equity trading at <unk> <unk> & <unk> in minneapolis said that <unk> <unk> actually _1848_ money on friday
it helped that _1849_ inventory is a third smaller now than it was two years ago he said
joseph <unk> president of the national association of securities dealers _1850_ oversees the nasdaq computerized trading system said that despite the rush of selling he never considered the situation an emergency
the pace of trading was orderly he said
nasdaq 's small order execution system worked <unk> as did the automated system for larger trades _1852_ to mr. <unk>
nevertheless the shock of another steep plunge in stock prices undoubtedly will shake many investors _1853_ confidence
in the past the otc market <unk> on a firm base of <unk> _1854_
because nasdaq 's trading volume has n't returned to <unk> levels traders and otc market officials hope the damage wo n't _1855_ permanent
_1856_ they are worried
we were just starting to get the public 's confidence back <unk> mr. mullins of dean _1857_
more troubling is the prospect that the overall collapse in stock prices could permanently erode the base of <unk> support the otc market was struggling to rebuild in _1858_ wake of the october N crash
mr. <unk> of <unk> <unk> says some action from government policy makers would <unk> investor fears
it wo _1860_ take much more to scare the hell out of retail investors he says
the sellers on friday came from all corners of the otc market big and small institutional investors as well _1861_ individual investors and market makers
but <unk> traders said the sell orders generally ranged from N shares to N shares _1862_ with blocks of N shares or more two years ago
_1863_ 's mr. dapuzzo said retail investors nervously sold stock friday and never returned to <unk>
institutional investors which had been selling stock throughout last _1864_ to lock in <unk> gains made through the third quarter were <unk>
we had a good amount of selling _1865_ institutions but not as much panic mr. dapuzzo said
if they could n't _1866_ some of them put the shares back on the shelf
_1867_ addition he said some bigger institutional investors placed bids to buy some otc stocks whose prices were beaten down
in _1868_ mr. dapuzzo said computer-guided program selling of otc stocks in the russell index of N small stocks and the standard & poor 's 500-stock index sent <unk> waves through the market
nasdaq _1869_ biggest stocks were <unk>
the nasdaq N index of the largest <unk> issues including the big otc technology issues tumbled N N or N to _1870_
the nasdaq financial index of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped N N or N to _1871_

pension _1934_ insurers and other <unk> of the investing world said they began <unk> up stocks during friday 's market rout
_1935_ they plan to buy more today
<unk> or <unk> many giant institutional investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the october _1936_ crash buying at the bottom pays off
to be sure big investors might put away their <unk> in a hurry if stocks open sharply _1937_ today
they _1938_ still panic and bail out of the market
but their N performance indicates that they wo _1939_ abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse
last time we got <unk> for _1940_ out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst said john w. rogers president of chicago-based <unk> capital management inc. which manages $ N billion of stocks
mr. rogers _1941_ half his cash on hand friday for our favorite stocks that have fallen apart
he expects to _1942_ the rest if the market <unk> further
<unk> portfolio manager james craig was n't <unk> when friday _1943_ rout <unk> $ N million from the value of the $ N million <unk> fund he oversees
i waited to make sure all the program _1944_ had kicked through he said
then he jumped into the market
i spent _1946_ N million in the last half-hour
other money managers also opened _1947_ <unk>
i was buying at the close friday and i 'll be buying again because i know we 're getting good value said frederick a. <unk> president of <unk> asset management inc. greenwich _1948_
there _1949_ no <unk> on the fundamental level for this crash
unlike mutual funds which can _1950_ forced to sell <unk> when investors rush to withdraw money big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market <unk> without <unk> stock
most often they do just _1951_ because stocks have proved to be the <unk> long-term investment attracting about $ N trillion from pension funds alone
if you bought after the crash you did very very well off the bottom said stephen b. <unk> chief investment officer of _1952_ kemper financial services inc
the $ N billion california public employees retirement system _1953_ one added $ N billion to its stock portfolio two years ago
the last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders and that they ca n't react to short-term events good or bad said stephen l. <unk> _1954_ vice president for the pension consultants <unk> associates in santa <unk> calif
those that pulled out of stocks <unk> it he said so i doubt you 'll see any significant changes in institutional portfolios as a result of _1955_ 's decline
stocks as measured by the standard & poor 's 500-stock index have been <unk> performers _1956_ year rising N N before friday 's plunge excluding dividends
even friday 's slump leaves investors _1957_ more than N N well above the annual average for stocks over several decades
you could go down N points and still have a good year in the market said james d. <unk> president _1958_ new york-based <unk> capital corp
mr. <unk> however worries that the market could go down N or N points _1959_ the next few days
it can _1960_ before you can turn around
he said he <unk> many parallels _1961_ N including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the <unk> of computerized program trading
the only thing you do n't have he said is the portfolio insurance phenomenon <unk> on _1962_ rest
most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance _1963_ technique which is widely thought to have <unk> the N crash
not really insurance this <unk> was designed to soften the blow _1964_ declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of s&p futures contracts
in its <unk> test the $ N billion of portfolio insurance _1965_ effect in the N crash did n't work as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became <unk>
even without portfolio insurance market conditions were grim friday money _1966_ said
neil <unk> whose new york-based _1967_ capital partners had converted N N of its $ N million investment pool to cash in recent months said he was besieged by wall street firms friday asking him to take stock off their hands
we got calls from big block _1968_ asking us if we want to make bids on anything said mr. <unk> who happy with his returns on investments <unk> up earlier declined the offers
mr. <unk> predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in _1969_ next few days before declining again <unk> more investors
i think it _1970_ be a <unk> <unk> rally he said
_1971_ friday brought a <unk> for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally
especially <unk> were _1972_ short sellers who have been <unk> by this year 's market climb
the <unk> sell borrowed shares _1973_ to profit by replacing them later at a lower price
the nation 's largest <unk> operation is <unk> brothers palo alto calif. which said last may that its short positions had shown losses of N N for _1974_ year up to that point
all that _1975_ has changed
we _1976_ ahead for the year because of friday said the firm 's kurt <unk>
we _1977_ not making a killing but we had a good day
food and drug administration spokesman jeff <unk> said _1978_ agency has turned over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning <unk> pharmaceuticals inc. to the u.s. attorney 's office in baltimore
neither <unk> nor any of the <unk> gardens n.y. company 's officials or employees have been _1979_ with any crimes
<unk> won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine _1980_ acknowledged that it <unk> a <unk> <unk> plc product as its own in tests
mr. <unk> also said the fda has asked <unk> pharmaceutical co. to recall _1981_ the retail level its <unk> <unk> <unk>
but so far the company _1982_ n't <unk> with that request the spokesman said
<unk> the subject of a criminal investigation by the fda and the inspector _1983_ 's office of the health and human services department only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of <unk> as far down as direct customers mostly <unk> mr. <unk> said
<unk> of <unk> _1984_ earlier began a voluntary recall of both its N <unk> and N <unk> versions of the drug
the fda has said it presented evidence it _1985_ to the company indicating that <unk> <unk> the <unk> product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of <unk>
<unk> has denied that it switched the <unk> product _1986_ its own in such testing
the west german retailer <unk> deutsche <unk> ag plans to challenge the <unk> of a widely employed anti-takeover defense of _1987_ in the netherlands
the eventual court decision could become a landmark in dutch corporate law because the lawsuit <unk> plans to file would be the first to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares _1988_ <unk> trusts to <unk> voting power of common stockholders
up to now only specific _1989_ of these defenses have been challenged though unsuccessfully <unk> 's dutch lawyers noted
should the courts <unk> the <unk> of this type of defense <unk> will then ask the court to <unk> such a <unk> maneuver recently deployed by <unk> _1990_ <unk>
_1991_ says the <unk> international food retailer had n't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus <unk> the worth and voting power of <unk> and other shareholders
speaking through its dutch lawyers <unk> also disclosed it holds a N N _1992_ in <unk>
it was previously thought <unk> held a N N stake _1993_ was accumulated since july
a spokesman for <unk> said his company is confident of its own position and the <unk> _1994_ the <unk> issue
he termed <unk> 's legal actions as <unk> to international cooperation among _1995_ retailers
chase manhattan bank chairman <unk> butcher _1996_ a conservative banker and a loyal republican but on friday morning he had few kind words for president bush 's economic <unk>
there are some very significant issues out there _1997_ as the fiscal deficit the trade deficit our relations with japan that have to be the subject of major initiatives he said in an interview
_1998_ 'd like to see that initiative and i have n't
there is n't a big shot _1999_ agenda
a few hours later the _2000_ market dropped N points
politicians tried to finger each other for the _2001_ although many analysts doubt that washington was <unk> responsible for wall street 's woes
but mr. butcher 's comments make _2002_ thing clear some on wall street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy
_2003_ this
by N p.m. tonight president bush must order $ N billion of automatic across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with _2004_ gramm-rudman budget law
the cuts are necessary because congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement _2005_ a <unk> bill
we simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and _2006_ tough choices house budget committee chairman leon <unk> d. calif said yesterday on nbc news 's meet the press
for the last _2007_ weeks the bush administration and the federal reserve have been engaged in a <unk> battle over international economic policy
the administration has been trying to push the dollar _2008_ the fed has been <unk>
one of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary <unk> between the _2009_ department and the federal reserve board said lawrence <unk> a bear stearns & co. economist on abc 's this week
the administration has sent out confusing signals about its response _2010_ a recent spate of airline takeovers
last month transportation secretary sam skinner forced northwest airlines to reduce a stake held by <unk> _2011_ dutch airlines
_2012_ he has since run into opposition from the treasury and the white house over that decision
and he has kept <unk> on how his decision _2013_ affect a bid for united airlines which includes a big stake by british airways plc
some analysts say uncertainty about washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the united airlines takeover fell through the event that triggered the _2014_ drop
in many ways the backdrop to friday 's stock decline is <unk> similar to _2015_ of october N 's <unk> crash
then as now the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending _2016_ were within days of taking hold
the treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy although at that time it was with west german officials rather than _2017_ federal reserve
and concern about official actions aimed at takeovers then by the <unk> house ways and means committee rather than the transportation department _2018_ making markets nervous
the N crash brought the reagan administration and democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ N billion _2019_ though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ N billion during that period
but barring further drops in the market this week a similar outcome does n't seem _2020_ this year
lawmakers and administration officials agree that friday 's drop by itself is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's <unk> plan which still is n't fully _2021_
one of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that as everyone learned in N _2022_ economy and the market can survive a one-day <unk> tumble
everybody thought we _2023_ looking at a <unk> of N that we were looking at a recession rep. <unk> said yesterday in an interview
that _2024_ not happen
they learned _2025_ could survive it without much problem
but administration officials privately agree with mr. <unk> who said a _2026_ drop this week is going to force the president and congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy
in _2027_ case there will be plenty of blame to go around
there is an underlying concern on the part of the american people and there should be that the administration _2028_ not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut said senate finance committee chairman lloyd <unk> d. texas
nevertheless it clearly will take more than friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and white house budget director richard darman _2029_ the capital-gains fight
hill democrats are particularly angry over mr. bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of april 's budget accord and his insistence on combining _2030_ with the deficit-reduction legislation
there is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise _2031_ deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine said yesterday on cbs news 's face the nation
during last week 's <unk> on the <unk> bill and the capital-gains issue there were signs that senate republicans and the administration _2032_ at odds
at the very moment that senate republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy _2033_ include it
when an agreement was reached to strip capital _2034_ from the legislation oregon sen. bob packwood the ranking gop member of the <unk> senate finance committee hailed it
asked if _2035_ administration agreed he <unk> replied the <unk> will have to speak for itself
friday 's market tumble could spur action on <unk> the house and senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the <unk>
senate republicans expressed the hope that the house would follow the lead of the senate which on friday agreed to drop _2037_ variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal N deficit
the market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction and the best way to do that is for the house of representatives to strip _2038_ bill of similar provisions sen. warren <unk> r. <unk> said yesterday
the white house office of management and budget whose calculations determine whether the gramm-rudman targets are met estimated that the house-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal N <unk> by $ N billion almost half of the congressional budget office 's estimate of _2039_ N billion
rep. <unk> said that <unk> 's figure _2040_ still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts but added we 're getting very close to the margins here
no one in washington was willing to take the blame for <unk> friday 's _2041_ in the stock market
but _2042_ players were quick to seize the moment
before the sun had set on friday richard <unk> the _2043_ chief economist of the u.s. chamber of commerce issued a statement <unk> the drop in stock prices to the senate decision to postpone action on capital gains
investors who had been holding assets _2044_ anticipation of a more favorable time to sell were spooked he said
there have been many <unk> _2045_ advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut sen. mitchell said during his television appearance but i suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others

small investors matched their big institutional <unk> in anxiety over the weekend but most seemed to be taking a <unk> _2096_ and said they were resigned to riding out the latest storm in the stock market
i 'm not losing faith in the market said boston lawyer christopher sullivan as he watched the market _2097_ on a big screen in front of a brokerage firm
but he _2098_ not so sure about everyone else
i think on monday the small investors are going to panic and sell predicted mr. _2099_ whose investments include amr corp. 's american airlines unit and several mutual funds
and i think institutions are going to come in _2100_ buy
i 'm going to hold _2101_
if i sell now i 'll take a big loss
some <unk> an optimism that had been <unk> when they did n't <unk> the _2103_ in N
oh i bet it 'll be up N points on monday said <unk> <unk> a <unk> retired <unk> in lexington _2104_
mrs. <unk> said her <unk> investment club 's portfolio lost about _2105_ of its value following the black monday crash but no one got discouraged and we gained that back and more
at the annual congress of the national association of investors corp. at the <unk> <unk> hotel in _2106_ the scene was calm
some N investors representing investor clubs from around the u.s. were attending when the _2107_ started to slide friday
but robert <unk> an official _2108_ the association said no special <unk> or emergency meetings of the investors ' clubs are planned
in fact some of the association 's _2109_ long-term <unk> investors welcomed the drop in prices
we hope to take advantage of it said john <unk> _2110_ member of a los angeles investors ' club
he has four stocks in mind to buy if the prices _2111_ to the level he wants
not everyone is reacting so <unk> however and many wonder about the long-term implications of what _2112_ widely viewed as the cause of friday 's slide reluctance by banks to provide financing for a buy-out of ual corp. parent of united airlines
marc <unk> a tampa fla. investment banker said the _2113_ drop is one of a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged <unk> era is ending
there 's no question _2114_ there 's a general <unk> for leverage among lenders
mr. <unk> believes however _2115_ the market could be stabilized if california investor marvin davis steps back in to the united bidding with an offer of $ N a share
<unk> albert a <unk> dallas law student says she 's generally <unk> _2116_ the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it
i have this feeling that it 's built on sand she says that _2117_ market rises but there 's no foundation to it
she and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after _2118_ N crash although she still owns some texaco stock
partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant to go to school i think at this point we want to be a lot _2119_ liquid
others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand
we all assumed october <unk> was a one-time shot said san francisco attorney david greenberg
we told the little guy it could only happen once in a _2122_ come on back
now it _2123_ happening again
mr. greenberg got out just before the N crash and to his regret never went back even as the market soared
this time he 's ready to buy in when the _2125_ wears off
still he adds _2126_ ca n't have this kind of thing happen very often
when the _2127_ guy gets frightened the big guys hurt badly
merrill lynch ca n't survive without the little guy
small investors have <unk> back into the market following black monday but mostly _2129_ mutual funds
discount brokerage customers have been in the market somewhat but not whole <unk> like they were two years ago says leslie quick jr. _2130_ of the quick & <unk> discount brokerage firm

individual investors are still angry about _2132_ trading mr. <unk> says
<unk> <unk> a cornell _2133_ finance professor says government regulators will have to more closely control program trading to win back the confidence of the small investor
but it 's not only the _2134_ market that has some small investors worried
alan <unk> general sales manager of a chrysler dealership in houston said he and his _2135_ have some joint stock investments but the overall economy is his chief worry
_2136_ high <unk> took a big <unk> today he said in his showroom which is within a few miles of the <unk> dollar homes of some of houston 's <unk> citizens

the crowded field for <unk> computers is about to become a lot _2145_ crowded
compaq computer corp. 's long-awaited entry today into the notebook field is expected to put immediate heat on others in the market especially zenith electronics corp. _2146_ current market leader and on a <unk> of promising <unk>
compaq 's series of _2147_ <unk> a trend toward <unk> in the personal computer market
one manufacturer already has _2148_ a <unk> computer called a <unk> and two others have introduced even smaller <unk>
_2149_ those machines are still considered <unk> with <unk> only a <unk> could love and screens to match
compaq 's <unk> by contrast may be the first in _2150_ weight class not to <unk> on features found in much bigger machines
analysts say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market and they 're priced aggressively _2151_ $ N to $ N
all of _2152_ comes in a machine that <unk> only six pounds and fits <unk> into most <unk>
in recent months compaq 's _2153_ including zenith toshiba corp. tandy corp. and nec corp. all have introduced <unk> that weigh approximately the same and that are called <unk> perhaps <unk>
one analyst noting that most such machines are about two inches thick takes exception _2154_ the name
this is n't quite a notebook i call it a <unk> he _2155_
that ca n't be said of the $ _2156_ <unk> computer introduced a few weeks ago by grid systems corp. a unit of tandy
instead of a <unk> it features a writing surface an _2157_ <unk> and the ability to read block printing
at N N pounds it may be too <unk> named but it _2158_ opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts <unk>
<unk> are n't far behind
<unk> corp. 's portfolio introduced in europe two months ago and in the u.s. in early september <unk> less than a pound costs a mere $ N and runs on three <unk> <unk> yet has the power to run some <unk> and _2160_ processing programs
some _2161_ however say its ability to run <unk> programs is restricted by a limited memory
<unk> computer corp. meanwhile has introduced a much more sophisticated <unk> that can run lotus N _2162_ other sophisticated software programs but costs five times as much
at stake is what mike <unk> compaq 's president of north america operations calls the <unk> <unk> of the computer industry the search for a real computer in a package so small you can take _2163_ everywhere
the market is _2164_ new nobody knows yet how big it can be
i 've had a lot of people trying to sell me services _2165_ find out how big it is says tom <unk> director of marketing for grid
whether it 's $ N billion or $ N _2166_ it does n't matter
it _2167_ huge
consider the growth of <unk> which now <unk> N _2168_ of all personal computer sales
<unk> generally anything under N pounds have become the fastest-growing personal computer segment with sales doubling this year
_2170_ to that demand however has led to a variety of <unk>
making computers smaller often means _2171_ memory
it also has <unk> use _2172_ the faster more powerful microprocessors found in increasing numbers of desktop machines
size and weight considerations also have _2173_ screen displays
the competitive <unk> can get pretty <unk> _2174_ times
a <unk> spokesman for example <unk> the <unk> portfolio because it requires three <unk> while the <unk> needs only two
both <unk> are dismissed by notebook makers who argue that they 're too small a problem <unk> also encountered in focus groups admits <unk> <unk> _2176_ of marketing
<unk> _2177_ to avoid the <unk> label responded with the tag line the <unk> pc a very big computer
despite the <unk> few question the <unk> of the move _2178_ small machines that do n't make <unk>
toward that end experts say the real battle will take _2179_ between <unk> players like toshiba zenith and now compaq
compaq 's new machines are considered a direct threat to start-up firms like <unk> inc. which introduced in june a computer that like compaq 's uses an intel N microprocessor _2180_ has a hard disk drive
but the <unk> product is twice as heavy _2181_ costs more than compaq 's
compaq 's announcement also <unk> trouble for zenith which last year had N N of the u.s. laptop market _2182_ recently agreed to sell its computer business to cie. des machines bull the french government-owned computer maker
zenith holders will vote in december on the proposed $ N million sale a price _2183_ could slip because it is pegged to zenith 's share and sales
compaq is already taking aim at zenith 's market _2184_
_2185_ <unk> compaq 's president and chief executive officer notes <unk> that zenith 's $ N <unk> uses an <unk> <unk> <unk> disk <unk> compaq 's new machines use the more common N <unk> disk
john p. frank _2186_ of zenith data systems simply <unk> off such criticism noting that N <unk> <unk> were also <unk> when they first replaced <unk> disks
we do n't look at it as not being a _2187_ we look at it as a new standard he argues

compaq 's machines include the N <unk> <unk> disk drive a <unk> screen that is only <unk> thick and an internal expansion <unk> for a _2192_ in other words almost all the <unk> of a typical office machine
others undoubtedly will follow but most analysts _2193_ compaq has at least a six-month lead on the competition
toshiba 's line of <unk> for example features the <unk> which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory and the <unk> which also uses a N microprocessor but which <unk> almost twice as much and is three times _2194_ size

investors who bought stock with borrowed money _2228_ is on margin may be more worried than most following friday 's market drop
that 's because _2229_ brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans
in october N these margin calls were _2230_ to have contributed to the downward <unk> of the stock market
typically _2231_ margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below N N of its original value

the garden city n.y. <unk> company said it wo n't renew contracts with nwa inc. 's northwest airlines unit pan am corp. 's pan american world airways unit and <unk> airlines _2240_ the end of this year
but it remains involved in programs with amr corp. 's american airlines unit and delta air lines
industry estimates put <unk> 's annual cost of all five programs at between $ N million _2242_ $ N million
a spokesman for <unk> would n't specify the costs but said the three _2243_ being dropped account for far less than half of the total
budget _2244_ a car corp. of chicago and national car rental systems inc. of minneapolis both said they had no plans to follow suit
in fact budget indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs in which <unk> earn <unk> _2245_ and <unk> can get <unk> discounts
i _2246_ not see how this news by hertz and <unk> can not benefit budget 's programs said bob wilson budget 's vice president marketing planning
northwest and <unk> are two of the five airlines _2247_ which budget has agreements
national also <unk> in the northwest <unk> program along with four other airlines including delta and usair group inc. 's usair unit

at the time hertz _2250_ its annual fees to those airlines amounted to $ N million and that the value of redeemed <unk> topped $ N million
analysts and competitors however doubt the numbers _2251_ that high
budget said its <unk> _2252_ are substantially below <unk> 's level
robert d. <unk> <unk> vice president of marketing said the proliferation and _2253_ attached to <unk> programs have significantly diminished their value

tandem computers inc. preparing to fight with international business machines corp. for a piece of the mainframe business said it expects to post higher revenue and earnings _2264_ its fiscal fourth quarter ended sept. N
tandem said it expects to report revenue of about $ N million and earnings _2265_ N cents to N cents a share
the results which are in line with analysts ' estimates reflect a continued improvement in our u.s. business said james <unk> tandem 's _2266_ executive officer
in the year-earlier period tandem reported net income of $ N million or N cents a share on revenue of $ N _2267_
tandem expects to _2268_ the full results for the quarter next week
analysts have predicted that the cupertino calif. company will report revenue of $ N million to $ _2269_ million and earnings of N cents to N cents a share
commenting on the results for the _2270_ mr. <unk> said the strength of the company 's domestic business came as a surprise to him noting that sales in every region of the u.s. exceeded our plan
the company _2271_ u.s. performance was helped by a record quarter for new customers he said
tandem makes <unk> computers machines with <unk> backup systems that run stock exchanges networks of automatic <unk> and other complex computer _2272_
tomorrow the company is scheduled to announce its most powerful computer ever which for the first time _2273_ bring it into direct competition with makers of mainframe computers
tandem 's new high-end computer is called _2274_
prices for the machine which can come in _2275_ <unk> are $ N million to $ N million
analysts expect the _2276_ computer to <unk> a hefty <unk> of business away from ibm the longtime leader in mainframes
we _2277_ they could <unk> perhaps two to three billion dollars from ibm over the next few years said george weiss an analyst at the gartner group
that will _2278_ tandem 's growth
i 'd be disappointed if the company grew by _2279_ than N N next year said john <unk> an analyst at goldman sachs & co
ibm is expected to respond to tandem 's <unk> by _2280_ its own mainframes which analysts say are roughly three times the price of a comparable system from tandem
obviously ibm _2281_ give bigger discounts to users immediately said mr. weiss
but mr. <unk> questions whether that will be enough to stop tandem 's first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations _2282_ sought from big blue 's machines
the answer is n't price _2283_ but new systems he said
nevertheless tandem faces a variety of challenges the biggest being that customers generally view the company 's computers _2284_ <unk> to ibm 's mainframes
even mr. <unk> is reluctant to abandon this notion insisting that tandem 's new machines _2285_ n't <unk> for ibm 's mainframes
we 're after a little bigger niche he _2286_
do n't _2287_ yet
the stock market 's <unk> may _2288_ out to be good news for the economy
in one wild hour of trading the market managed to accomplish what the bush administration has been trying to do unsuccessfully _2289_ weeks
it is forcing the federal _2290_ to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously <unk> dollar
the resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could <unk> american business _2291_ the entire economy
this may _2292_ <unk> optimistic
after all until a few years ago the stock market was viewed _2293_ a barometer of the national economy
when _2294_ went down by all tradition the economy followed
that has changed partly because the two years following the worst stock-market plunge in _2295_ have been reasonably comfortable
the N crash was a _2296_ alarm however you view it says university of chicago economist victor <unk>
the market seems increasingly _2297_ from the rest of the nation
its <unk> ca _2298_ be <unk> to fundamental business conditions nor do they appear to <unk> major shifts in the economy
the market today has a life of its own john <unk> chairman of _2299_ business machines corp. said saturday
there _2300_ nothing rational about this kind of action
of course the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this _2301_
sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth damage business confidence and _2302_ the foreign investors upon whom the u.s. now relies for financial <unk>
the financial-services industry was battered by _2303_ N crash
what 's more although the stock market is far less <unk> today than two years ago the _2304_ economy is weaker
growth _2305_ slower
_2306_ are softer
debt burdens are heavier
but if the stock market _2308_ n't continue to plummet the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate
the fed which until friday had been _2309_ moves to ease credit is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to <unk> the markets
fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies
but the experience of the N crash suggests the fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort _2311_ calm markets
anticipating _2312_ fed 's move money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the federal funds rate to N N late friday down from N N the day before
tiny movements in the rate which is _2313_ banks charge each other for overnight loans are usually among the few visible tracks that the fed leaves on the monetary markets
the dollar also began to decline friday as the stock market 's plunge caused some investors _2314_ <unk> their desire to invest in the u.s.
treasury officials have been arguing for months _2315_ the dollar 's strength was out of <unk> with economic fundamentals threatening to <unk> the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several years
the market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the treasury was right about _2316_ <unk> dollar
a _2317_ drop in the dollar only a modest one mind you would be welcomed by the u.s.
that was n't the case in N when the dollar was so weak _2318_ some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse producing panic among foreign investors and <unk> the flow of foreign capital to the u.s.
another big difference between N and N is _2319_ so <unk>
in the third quarter of N the _2320_ <unk> at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of N N
the consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish N N in the third quarter _2321_ N which ended two weeks ago
the plunge in stock prices is happening at a time when _2322_ economy has already slowed down says economist lawrence <unk> of <unk> group a <unk> <unk> pa. forecasting company
a lot of <unk> _2323_ is gone
consumer spending did drop in the months following black monday N but _2324_ slightly and for a short period of time recalls mr. <unk> a longtime student of business cycles
that was offset by _2325_ elsewhere
the effects were much less severe _2326_ less prolonged than some had feared or expected
today he <unk> exports and business investment spending may _2327_ insufficient to pick up the slack if stock prices sink this week and if consumers <unk> in reaction
what 's more the corporate _2328_ binge has n't <unk> in the past two years
we 've had two more years of significant accumulation of debt just at the time when earnings _2329_ being squeezed mr. <unk> notes
the more a company relies on borrowed money the greater its <unk> _2330_ an economic slowdown
_2331_ company with a strong balance sheet can withstand an unanticipated storm a highly leveraged company may end up in bankruptcy court
the fed of course knows that very well hence its <unk> to pump credit _2332_ the economy this morning
_2333_ in the process the fed risks <unk> inflation
even before friday 's events harvard university economist benjamin <unk> was arguing that the fed wo n't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets _2334_ and highly leveraged corporations
the biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n't recession he reasons it _2335_ an <unk> of <unk> inflation
in the end the N collapse suggested the economy _2336_ n't move in <unk> with stock prices
the economy does however depend on the confidence of businesses consumers and foreign investors
_2338_ panic on wall street does n't exactly <unk> confidence
surveys suggested that consumer _2339_ was high before friday
a 190-point drop is n't likely to make much of a <unk> <unk> that a few times over though and _2340_ will
if the reactions of executives gathered saturday at hot _2341_ va. for the business council meetings are typical business leaders were n't overly rattled by friday 's decline
and if foreign investors become a <unk> more cautious well the dollar 's recent strength suggests that the u.s. can _2342_ it
on the _2343_ line the most <unk> fact for the economic outlook is that we 've been through this before
two years ago about _2344_ only point of comparison was the N crash and the subsequent depression
the <unk> _2345_ a <unk> audience
the prosperity that followed black monday _2346_ a more optimistic view today
at _2347_ very least the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation 's success in handling the last <unk>
as sen. lloyd <unk> d. texas observed yesterday the fed _2348_ a <unk> last time
they are _2349_ sophisticated this time

perhaps most prominent dow chemical co. which as of midyear had racked up eight consecutive record quarters is expected to _2355_ that profit decreased in the latest quarter from a year earlier if only by a <unk>

you will find the _2360_ off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better says james wilbur a smith barney analyst
first boston corp. projects that N of the N _2361_ it follows will report lower profit
most of the N have big <unk> operations
still some industry _2363_ are expected to report continuing gains largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals
du pont co. _2364_ thought to have had steady profit growth in white <unk> fibers and <unk>
moreover the wilmington del. company is helped when prices _2365_ on the commodity chemicals it buys for its own production needs such as <unk>
analysts are divided over whether du pont will report much of a gain in the latest quarter from its <unk> inc. _2366_ company

du pont _2369_ to comment
monsanto co. too is expected to _2370_ reporting higher profit even though its sales of crop chemicals were hurt in the latest quarter by drought in northern europe and the western u.s.
the st. <unk> company is expected to report again that losses in its <unk> searle & _2371_ pharmaceutical business are narrowing
searle continued to operate in the red through the first half of the year but monsanto has said it expects _2372_ to post a profit for all of N
most _2373_ for monsanto run between $ N and $ N a share
a year ago the company _2374_ third-quarter profit of $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion
monsanto _2375_ to comment
but the _2376_ producers are caught on the downside of a pricing cycle
by some accounts _2377_ wall street and in the industry the inventory reductions are near an end which may <unk> firmer demand
but <unk> say growing production capacity could _2378_ pressure on prices into the early 1990s
in the latest quarter _2379_ least profit is expected to fall sharply
for <unk> inc. how far down _2380_ is we do n't know says leslie <unk> at salomon brothers
the projections are in the neighborhood _2381_ N cents a share to N cents compared with a restated $ N a share a year earlier when profit was $ N million on sales of $ N million

the company based in wilmington del. is <unk> by montedison s.p a. milan which _2383_ an offer outstanding for the <unk> shares it does n't already own
at quantum chemical corp. new york the trouble is lower _2384_ for polyethylene higher debt costs and the <unk> of an important plant due to an explosion
some analysts hedge their estimates for quantum because it is n't known when the company will book certain one-time charges
but the estimates _2386_ from break-even to N cents a share
in the N third quarter quantum earned $ N million or $ N a _2387_ on sales of $ N million

economists are divided as to how _2422_ manufacturing strength they expect to see in september reports on industrial production and capacity utilization also due tomorrow
meanwhile september housing starts due wednesday are thought _2423_ have inched upward
there 's a possibility of a surprise in the trade report said michael <unk> director of _2424_ at <unk>
a widening of the deficit if _2425_ were combined with a <unk> strong dollar would <unk> trade problems but the dollar weakened friday as stocks plummeted
in any event mr. <unk> and many _2426_ say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made
trade is definitely going to be _2427_ politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow he said
exports are _2428_ to have risen strongly in august but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports economists said
views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read september 's low level of factory job growth _2429_ a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more <unk> total employment figures in their calculations

instead of closing ranks to protect the firm 's reputation the executive 's internal rivals led by _2466_ <unk> american demand his resignation
the plot is <unk> when the firm 's major _2467_ <unk> <unk> on the other side of the globe <unk> home to support the executive
_2468_ the investigation continues
if you can <unk> _2469_ <unk> that the rewards for such <unk> are <unk> salaries you still are left <unk> because few of the <unk> consume very <unk>
_2470_ fact few consume much of anything
two share a _2471_ almost <unk> of furniture
<unk> lives in a hotel room and although she drives a <unk> <unk> she has n't time to clean or repair it the <unk> vehicle can be started only with a _2472_ pair of <unk> because the <unk> key has broken off in the lock
and it takes <unk> the <unk> <unk> ' man of the cast until the third episode to get past first base with any of _2473_ <unk>
perhaps the explanation for these <unk> is that <unk> britain _2474_ n't ready to come to terms with the wealth created by the <unk> <unk> regime
after all this is _2475_ old money but new money and in many cases young money
this attitude is clearly illustrated in the treatment of _2476_ the trading room 's most flamboyant character
<unk> _2477_ he lives in a <unk> <unk> converted church wears designer clothes and drives an <unk> car
but apparently to make him <unk> even <unk> to the <unk> the script <unk> _2478_ max into an <unk> <unk> master of N chinese <unk>
he takes his wash to the <unk> where he meets a <unk> french girl who <unk> him into providing a home for her pet <unk> and then promptly <unk> his car and <unk> _2479_ in <unk>
in producing and promoting capital city <unk> has spent about as much as <unk> _2480_ loses on a good day
the production costs are a not <unk> # N million $ N million and _2481_ have been much higher had not the cost of the trading floor set been absorbed in the budget of dealers an earlier <unk> movie
another half _2482_ <unk> went for a <unk> of <unk> advertisements in six major british newspapers and for huge <unk> in the london subway
these expenses create a special incentive for capital city _2483_ producers to <unk> it or a <unk> version of it in america
_2484_ 's u.s. marketing agent donald <unk> is preparing to do just that
he is <unk> _2485_ citing three u.s. comedy series three 's company too close for comfort and check it out that had british <unk>
perhaps without <unk> it mr. <unk> simultaneously has put his finger on the problem and an ideal solution capital city should have been a comedy a worthy <unk> to the <unk> british carry on movies of the 1960s
the seeds already are in the _2487_
the first episode concluded with a <unk> <unk> scene in which _2488_ <unk> crew <unk> a baby the casualty of a broken marriage at the firm
and many in the _2489_ cast bear striking <unk> to american tv and movie <unk> known for light roles
<unk> <unk> looks like a young <unk> <unk> <unk> william armstrong who plays max could pass _2490_ <unk> <unk> and douglas <unk> <unk> for james <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> could easily double for <unk> hall the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> boys <unk>
so ok kids everybody on stage for carry on trading the cast is <unk> searching the office for <unk> japanese bonds that suddenly have soared in value because dai-ichi _2491_ bank has just bought the white house
the pressure is _2492_ much for <unk> <unk> who <unk> a security guard

it should run forever
mr. <unk> is _2496_ <unk> in the journal 's london bureau
<unk> assurances of france gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $ N billion _2497_ of farmers group inc. in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine u.s. states where farmers operates
the proposed acquisition is part of sir james goldsmith _2498_ unfriendly takeover attempt for b.a.t industries plc the british tobacco retailing paper and financial services concern that is parent of los angeles-based farmers
in an attempt to <unk> u.s. regulators ' concern over a goldsmith acquisition of farmers sir _2499_ in august agreed to sell farmers to axa if he is successful in acquiring b.a.t
as part of the agreement axa agreed to invest $ N billion in _2500_ investments ltd. sir james 's acquisition vehicle
of the total $ N billion to be paid to <unk> by axa about $ N billion will _2501_ from available resources of axa 's parent <unk> group $ N billion will be in the form of notes issued by axa and the remaining $ N billion will be in long-term bank loans
in an interview thursday <unk> bebear chairman and chief executive _2502_ of axa said his group has already obtained assurances from a group of banks led by cie financiere de paribas that they can provide the loan portion of the financing
the other banking companies in the group are credit lyonnais _2503_ generale bankamerica corp. and citicorp he said
mr. bebear said <unk> _2504_ has more than $ N billion of <unk> assets that we can and will sell to help pay off debt from the acquisition
he said the assets to be sold would be <unk> assets including a beer company and a real estate firm and would n't include any pieces of _2505_
we wo n't _2506_ any burden on farmers he said
the amended filings also point out that under a new agreement <unk> has an _2507_ obligation to sell farmers to axa upon an acquisition of b.a.t
we hope that with what we did the _2508_ will not need to evaluate <unk> and they can directly look at the agreement with us because <unk> wo n't be an owner of farmers at anytime mr. bebear said
any change of control in farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners _2509_ the nine states where farmers and its related companies are incorporated
_2510_ amended filings were required because of the new agreement between axa and <unk> and to reflect the extension that sir james received last month under british takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition
<unk> dropped its initial # N billion $ N billion takeover bid after it received the extension but said it would launch a new bid _2511_ and when the <unk> sale of farmers to axa receives regulatory approval
a spokesman for b.a.t said of the amended filings that it would appear that nothing <unk> has _2512_
the new financing structure is still a <unk> leveraged one and axa still plans to take _2513_ N N of farmers ' earnings as dividends to service their debt
that dividend is almost double the _2514_ N currently taken out of farmers by b.a.t the spokesman added
_2515_ would have severe implications for farmers ' policy holders
to fend off _2516_ james 's advances b.a.t has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would <unk> it to a tobacco and financial services concern
dismal sales at general motors corp. dragged the u.s. car and truck market down _2517_ year-ago levels in early october the first sales period of the N model year
the eight major domestic auto makers sold N north <unk> _2518_ in the first N days of october a N N drop from a year earlier
domestically _2519_ truck sales were down N N to N <unk> vans and sport utility vehicles
the heavy use of incentives to clear out N models appears to have taken the steam at least initially out of N model sales which began _2520_ oct. N
this appears particularly true _2521_ gm which had strong sales in august and september but saw its early october car and truck results fall N N from last year 's unusually high level
overall sales of all <unk> vehicles _2522_ N N from a year ago
without gm overall sales for the other u.s. <unk> were roughly _2523_ with N results
some of the u.s. auto _2524_ have already adopted incentives on many N models but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up
we 've created a condition where without incentives it 's a tough market said tom kelly sales manager for bill <unk> chevrolet _2525_ dearborn mich
_2526_ sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of N million vehicles the lowest since october N
the poor performance contrasts with a robust _2527_ rate of almost eight million last month
furthermore dealers contacted late last week said they could n't see any immediate impact on sales of friday 's _2528_ market decline
gm 's domestic car sales dropped N N and its domestic trucks were _2529_ an even <unk> N N from the same period a year ago
_2530_ of the gm divisions except cadillac showed big declines
cadillac posted a N N increase despite new competition from _2531_ the <unk> luxury-car division of toyota motor corp
lexus sales were n't available the cars are imported and toyota reports their sales only at <unk>
the sales drop for the no. N car maker may have been caused in part by the end in september of dealer incentives that gm offered in addition to consumer rebates and <unk> financing a company _2533_ said
last year gm had a different program in place that continued rewarding dealers until all _2534_ N models had been sold
aside from _2535_ other car makers posted generally mixed results
ford motor co. _2536_ a N N drop in domestic car sales but a N N increase in domestic truck sales
chrysler corp. had _2537_ N N drop in car sales <unk> its generally slow performance all year
_2538_ sales of trucks including the company 's popular minivans rose N N
honda motor co. 's sales of domestically _2539_ vehicles plunged N N from a year earlier
honda 's plant in <unk> ohio was <unk> up to build N _2540_ accords a honda spokesman said
we 're really _2541_ everything will bounce back to normal he added
separately chrysler said firm prices on its <unk> _2542_ cars and minivans will rise an average of N N over <unk> equipped N models
firm prices were generally in line with the _2543_ prices announced earlier this fall
at that _2544_ chrysler said base prices which are n't adjusted for equipment changes would rise between N N and N N on most vehicle

it was n't so long ago that a radio _2555_ funded by the u.s. congress and originally by the central intelligence agency was accused by officials here of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
now the network _2556_ opened a news bureau in the <unk> capital
employees held an open _2557_ to <unk> and even hung out a sign <unk> <unk> radio radio free europe
i think this is a victory for the radio says _2558_ de <unk> a <unk> former <unk> <unk> who works in the <unk> west germany headquarters as deputy director of the <unk> service
in fact the network hopes to set up _2559_ in warsaw and anywhere else in the east bloc that will have it
but the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders _2560_ <unk> the network 's life in more ways than one
in fact radio free europe is in danger _2561_ suffering from its success
while the network currently can operate freely in <unk> so can others
_2563_ addition competition for <unk> is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled
instead of being denounced as an evil agent _2564_ <unk> radio free europe is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too <unk> even boring
they have a lot to _2565_ these days to compete with <unk> radio says andrew <unk> a <unk> student at the technical university in <unk>
the <unk> radio reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what 's going on here
indeed hungary is in _2567_ midst of a media explosion
boys on busy _2568_ corners <unk> newspapers of every political <unk>
<unk> are packed with a <unk> _2569_ of magazines
radio and television are _2570_ <unk> and <unk>
the british broadcasting corp. and the u.s. state department 's _2571_ of america broadcast over <unk> <unk> though only a few hours a day each in <unk>
australian press <unk> rupert murdoch has bought N N stakes in two popular and <unk> <unk> _2572_ while britain 's robert maxwell has let it be known here that he is thinking about similar moves

with its mission for free speech and the capitalist way the network 's staff says it still has plenty to _2574_ in hungary and in the great eastern beyond
radio free europe and its sister station for the soviet union radio liberty say they wo n't cut back their _2575_ than N hours of daily <unk>
they are still an important source of news for _2576_ million <unk> in N exotic <unk> from <unk> and <unk> to <unk> and <unk>
the establishment of its first bureau in warsaw _2577_ territory shows the <unk> of some of the changes in eastern europe
months before the decision by the _2578_ communist party to <unk> itself socialist and try to look more appealing to voters the country 's <unk> were trying to look more <unk>
it proved a perfect time _2579_ radio free europe to ask for permission to set up office
not only did the <unk> ministry of foreign affairs _2580_ radio free europe 's new location but the ministry of telecommunications did something even more amazing they found us four phone lines in central <unk> says <unk> <unk> a radio free europe <unk> who helped <unk> the <unk> location
_2581_ is a <unk>
it 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network which had to overcome <unk> of its <unk> and <unk> of _2582_ <unk> who filed reports to the network by phone secret <unk> or letters
in fact some of the network 's <unk> <unk> say they owe radio free europe loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls the dark ages of _2583_ 20th century
during the past four years many of us have sat _2584_ until late at night listening to our <unk> says the writer
there were some very _2585_ <unk>
the <unk> too _2586_ to be <unk>
through much of the <unk> _2587_ ii period listening to western <unk> was a crime in hungary
when we listen to _2588_ europe station my mother still gets nervous says a <unk> <unk>
she wants to turn down the volume and close _2589_ <unk>
now _2590_ <unk> competition for radio free europe comes during the <unk> <unk>
<unk> radio often <unk> its most politically outspoken <unk> for around midnight
television which most of the time is considered rather <unk> has entered the running with _2592_ new program the end of the day which comes on after N p.m
it is a talk show with opposition leaders and _2593_ experts who discuss hungary 's domestic problems as well as foreign affairs
those who want to hear even more radical views _2594_ to get up at five on sunday morning for sunday journal on <unk> radio
the competitive _2595_ is clearly <unk> radio free europe which is trying to beef up programs
the <unk> office plans to hire free-lance reporters to cover the latest <unk> in <unk> country towns from <unk> _2596_ the west to <unk> in the east
the <unk> service has a daily <unk> news _2597_ called <unk> with international and domestic news plus a daily news review of opinions from around the world
there 's also a host _2598_ new programs trying to <unk> up on the traditional diet of politics
a daily <unk> _2599_ called the march of time tries to find interesting <unk> of <unk> news and <unk> from around the world
there 's a program _2600_ women and a science show
and to attract younger _2601_ radio free europe <unk> the latest in western rock groups
the pet shop _2602_ are big this year in <unk>
we are <unk> _2603_ all the news says mr. <unk> the student
every moment we _2604_ to know everything about the world
proposals for <unk> national service like <unk> <unk> up from time to time depress the resistance of the body <unk> run their course and seem to disappear only to <unk> _2605_ <unk> public life <unk>
the disease <unk> comes to mind of _2606_ not as an <unk> on the advocates of national service
rather it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly _2607_ <unk> of a <unk> idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early 1970s along with <unk>
it is back with us again in the _2608_ of legislation to pay <unk> under a national and community service act a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall
why _2609_ the <unk> virus keep coming back
perhaps it is because <unk> <unk> <unk> both military _2610_ and the social <unk>
if only we could get america 's <unk> youth into at least a <unk> uniform we _2611_ be able to teach <unk> again and revive the spirit of giving
a quarter of a century ago national service was <unk> as a way of <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the draft by of all things expanding the draft
those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all _2613_ people is still the true long-term aim of many <unk> backers despite their protests that present plans contain no <unk>
choice of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed to <unk> national service as much as the draft
but the virus was kept _2615_ in <unk> departments until a couple of years ago when it again was let loose
this time it attempted to <unk> two connected problems the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal _2616_ of educational grants and loans
why not keep and even expand the loans and grants the advocates <unk> but require some form of _2617_ from each <unk>
_2618_ service moreover could be a <unk> option
thus undoubtedly it was hoped that the new _2619_ of national service would prove <unk> <unk> <unk> conservatives <unk> <unk> and <unk> liberals
the democratic leadership council a <unk> group <unk> the plan surely thought it might help the party to _2620_ support especially among college students and their parents
a provision allowing grants to be applied to <unk> purchases was added to _2621_ to those who had had enough of <unk>
_2622_ <unk> plan <unk> <unk> <unk> trees <unk> <unk> <unk> children and <unk> <unk> for $ N a week tax free plus medical care
with a tax-free $ N <unk> payment at the end of each year the _2623_ would be making a wage comparable to $ N a year
mind you most of the <unk> would be <unk> N to <unk> some not even high school graduates and many saving money by living at home
they would be doing better financially under national _2625_ than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families
as it happened political resistance developed among educational and minority _2626_ that count on the present education grant system so the <unk> <unk> decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of give in order to get
opposition to national service from the pentagon which wants _2627_ protect its own <unk> process also led to the <unk> option being dropped
clearly a new _2628_ for national service had to be <unk> up
what better place to turn than sen. edward kennedy 's labor committee that great _2629_ of government <unk> where many a <unk> pot of <unk> is kept on the back <unk> until it can be brought forward and presented as <unk> <unk>
_2630_ the <unk> is printed the house may add more <unk> also changing the initial price now posted at some $ N million
it is _2631_ known that too many <unk> <unk> the <unk> but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the <unk> especially if they are senators
the omnibus bill coming out of congress may be <unk> <unk> but the <unk> chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the <unk> very _2632_
the <unk> of <unk> is _2633_ the air
is the voluntary _2634_ so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance
on the contrary _2635_ is as robust as ever
according to the <unk> poll american adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service while financial contributions to charity in the _2636_ have risen N N adjusted for inflation
even if government does see _2637_ <unk> needs national service is not the way to meet them
if we want to support students we might adopt the idea used in other _2638_ of offering more <unk> based on something called <unk> rather than on the government 's idea of service
_2639_ we might provide a tax credit for working students
what we do not need to do is start a _2640_ and then try to justify it by creating a <unk> bill
to the extent we lack manpower to staff <unk> jobs in hospitals for example we should raise pay pursue <unk> technology or allow more legal <unk> _2641_ than <unk> high school graduates as short-term workers and cause <unk> among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs
will national service in the current highly <unk> and _2642_ form <unk> enough appeal to get adopted
not _2643_
polls _2644_ wide <unk> support for some vague concept of service but the bill now under discussion lacks any <unk> public backing
nonetheless senate democrats are organizing a roll of supporting associations <unk> _2645_ <unk> some of which may hope to receive the paid <unk>
so far the president _2646_ <unk> to substitute any of the omnibus for his own <unk> proposal to <unk> a points of light foundation with $ N million to inform citizens of all ages and <unk> them to genuine <unk>
however even this <unk> plan could become <unk> if the white house gives in to congressional democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in <unk> federal funds for volunteer _2647_
there 's no need for such concessions
the omnibus _2649_ be defeated the virus controlled and real service protected
national service the <unk> idea still _2650_ n't go away then of course but the millions of <unk> youth performing works of civic content will be <unk> only in the <unk> of their <unk>

_2671_ debate over national service has begun again
after a decade in which more than N <unk> established their own service or conservation corps and dozens of school systems made community service a <unk> to high-school <unk> the focus has shifted to washington
at least N bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in _2673_ this spring
one <unk> by sen. sam <unk> d. <unk> and rep. dave <unk> d. okla. _2674_ have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served

it might well win senate passage
president bush has outlined his own youth entering _2677_ yes plan though its details remain to be specified
what is one to think of all this
doctrine and _2679_ interests govern some responses
people eager to have youth pay their <unk> to _2680_ favor service proposals <unk> mandatory ones
so do those who seek a <unk> concept of <unk> a concept imposing stern obligations as well as <unk> rights
then there _2682_ <unk> opponents
to <unk> mandatory service is an _2683_ and voluntary systems are <unk> uses of tax money
<unk> of the market question _2684_ value of the work national service would perform
if the market wo n't pay for it they argue it _2685_ n't be worth its cost
elements of the left are also <unk> opposed they see service as a cover for the draft or fear the <unk> of youth _2686_ want to see rights <unk> not obligations
but what about _2687_ of us whose views are not <unk> by formula or <unk>
how _2688_ we think about national service
let 's begin by recognizing a main _2689_ of confusion national service has no agreed meaning
_2690_ service be voluntary or <unk>
_2691_ or long
<unk> or full-time
paid or _2693_
_2694_ participants live at home and work nearby or live in <unk> and work on public <unk>
what kinds _2695_ work would they do
what _2696_ national mean
would the program be _2697_ by the federal government by local governments or by private voluntary organizations
and who would _2698_
only males as with the draft or both <unk>
youth only or all _2700_
middle-class people _2701_ poor people or a genuine <unk>
_2702_ or few
those are not <unk> questions and the label national service answers none of them
then how should we think _2704_ national service
as a starting point here are five <unk> _2705_ consider the <unk> not the name
ignore national service _2706_ the <unk> consider specific proposals
they will _2707_ in crucial ways
N service should be service
as _2709_ understood service implies sacrifice
it involves accepting _2710_ or giving up income or deferring a career
it follows that proposals like <unk> whose benefits to <unk> are worth some $ _2711_ a year do not qualify
there is a rationale for such bills federal subsidies to college students amount to a <unk> bill without the <unk> _2712_ those benefits should be earned not given
but the earnings exceed by N N the average income of young _2713_ graduates with full-time jobs
why call _2714_ service
N encouragement is _2715_ <unk> is not
<unk> service is unconstitutional
it is also <unk> and <unk>
who will throw several hundred thousand <unk> in jail each year
_2719_ through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior
it should also encourage service <unk> _2720_ all classes and all ages
its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of <unk> in the u.s. should build on the service programs already in existence and _2721_ honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing
N good programs are _2722_ cheap
enthusiasts assume _2723_ national service would get important work done <unk> forest fires fought housing <unk> students <unk> <unk> centers <unk>
there is important work to be done and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even <unk> who start with few skills can do much of _2724_ well but not <unk>
good service programs require <unk> <unk> training and _2725_ all of high quality
they involve <unk> _2726_ participants
full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision they are particularly expensive more per participant than a year _2727_ stanford or yale
<unk> programs are cheaper but good ones still come to some $ N _2728_ year
are they worth that
<unk> suggest that good _2730_ are especially so if the effects on participants are counted
but the calculations _2731_ <unk>
N <unk> _2732_ are a special concern
are _2733_ expenditures <unk> then
_2734_ if targeted
people of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve but there are many ways for middle-class kids and their elders to serve _2735_ little public cost
they can volunteer at any of thousands of <unk> institutions or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or _2736_
<unk> youth _2737_ n't have those opportunities
they are not <unk> in _2738_ school or college
_2739_ are unlikely to be employed
and they _2740_ grown up in <unk> grim circumstances among family structures breaking down surrounded by <unk> <unk> and bleak prospects
but many _2741_ them can be quite <unk> <unk> by productive and disciplined service
some wo n't accept the _2742_ others drop out for other reasons
but some _2743_ nothing else is reaching are transformed
learning skills producing something <unk> feeling useful they are _2744_ longer dependent others now depend on them
even if it is cheaper to build <unk> or <unk> apartments or plant <unk> with paid professionals the effects on the young people providing _2745_ services alter the <unk>
strictly speaking these youth are not performing _2746_
they are giving up no income deferring no careers _2747_ no risk
but they believe themselves to be serving and they begin to respect themselves and others to take control of their lives _2748_ think of the future
that is a service to the _2749_
it is what federal support should _2750_ hardest to achieve
mr. <unk> a carter administration budget official _2751_ his own washington-based strategic planning firm
he is a co-author of national service what _2752_ it mean
lexington _2753_ N
government officials here _2754_ in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a monday market <unk> but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan was on the telephones making it clear to officials in the u.s. and abroad that the fed was _2755_ to <unk> massive amounts of money into the banking system as it did in october N if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis
and at the treasury secretary nicholas brady talked with friends and associates _2756_ wall street while assistant secretary david mullins carefully <unk> data on the friday market plunge
but the officials feared that any public _2757_ would only increase market jitters
in addition officials at the fed and in the bush administration decided that avoiding <unk> actions and statements over _2758_ weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout
the disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing _2759_ much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis said one government official insisting on <unk>
the fed 's efforts at <unk> were partly <unk> sunday morning when both the new york times and the washington post carried stories <unk> a _2760_ fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system monday morning
fed chairman greenspan was surprised by both stories according to knowledgeable sources _2761_ insisted he had n't authorized any public comment
nevertheless fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate <unk> of the central bank 's game plan
it is prepared to assume the same role it played in october _2763_ providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system afloat
the fed provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial _2764_
the <unk> of federal officials was evident in the appearance sunday of budget director richard darman on _2765_ 's this week
secretary of the treasury brady and chairman greenspan and the chairman of the sec and others have been in _2766_ contact
i 'm sure they 'll do what 's right what 's prudent what 's <unk> he said
when it was suggested his comment was a <unk> mr. darman _2768_ it is a <unk>
but in _2769_ context that 's the smart thing to do
at the treasury secretary _2770_ issued a statement <unk> the stock market 's drop
today 's stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental _2771_ in the condition of the economy he said
the economy _2772_ <unk> and the outlook is for continued moderate growth
but administration officials conceded that friday 's _2773_ carried the chance of further declines this week
one possibility is that this is a surgical setback reasonably limited in its <unk> and not a major problem said _2774_ senior administration official who also asked that he not be named
the other is that we see another _2775_ disaster like two years ago
i think _2776_ 's less likely
nevertheless fed chairman greenspan and vice chairman manuel johnson were in their offices sunday evening monitoring events _2777_ they <unk> in markets around the world
the action was expected to begin with the opening of the new zealand foreign exchange markets at N p.m. est when stocks there plunged and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in tokyo and through early this _2778_ in europe
both the treasury and the fed planned to keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the _2779_
in tokyo share prices dropped sharply by N N in early monday _2780_ trading
after the initial slide the market appeared to be turning around but by early _2781_ was headed lower
in the bush administration the lead is being taken by treasury secretary brady undersecretary robert <unk> and assistant secretary _2782_
the three men worked together on the so-called brady commission headed by mr. brady which was established after the N crash to examine the market 's _2783_
as a result they have extensive knowledge in _2784_ markets and financial market crises
mr. brady _2785_ at the white house friday afternoon when the stock market 's decline began
he was quickly on the phone with mr. mullins _2786_ in turn was talking with the chairmen of the new york and chicago exchanges
later mr. brady <unk> mr. greenspan sec chairman richard _2787_ and numerous contacts in new york and overseas
aides say he continued _2788_ work the phones through the weekend
administration officials say president bush was <unk> throughout friday afternoon _2789_ evening even after leaving for camp david
he had frequent telephone <unk> with mr. brady and michael <unk> chairman of the counsel of economic advisers
government officials tried _2791_ the weekend to <unk> a <unk> appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic
treasury undersecretary david mulford for instance was at a meeting of the business council in hot springs va. when the _2792_ market fell and remained there through the following day
and as of last night fed chairman greenspan had n't _2793_ his plans to address the american bankers association convention in washington at N a.m. this morning
ironically mr. greenspan was scheduled to address the _2794_ convention in dallas on oct. N N
he flew to dallas on _2795_ N when the market plummeted N points but then turned around the next morning and returned to washington without delivering his speech

resist _2806_ urge to call your broker and sell all your stocks
that 's _2807_ advice of most investment professionals after friday 's 190-point drop in the dow jones industrial average
no one can say for sure what will happen _2808_
and investment pros are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in the next six _2809_
but they 're nearly <unk> on one _2810_ do n't sell into a panic
investors who sold _2811_ after the crash of N lived to regret it
even after friday 's _2812_ the dow jones industrial average was N N above where it landed on oct. N two years ago
panic selling also _2813_ <unk> during other big declines in the past
the crash of N _2814_ followed by a substantial recovery before the great depression and awful bear market of the 1930s began
the october <unk> of _2815_ and N were scary but did n't lead to severe or sustained <unk>
indeed some pros see friday 's plunge plus any further damage that might occur early this week _2816_ a chance for bargain hunting
there has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying _2817_ if you 've got the cash says stephen b. <unk> chief investment officer of chicago-based kemper financial services inc
but most advisers think the _2818_ course for individual investors should be to stand pat
when you see _2819_ runaway train says steve <unk> partner in the san francisco investment advisory firm brouwer & <unk> you wait for the train to stop
even for people _2820_ expect a bear market in coming months and a sizable number of money managers and market <unk> do the advice is wait for the market to bounce back and sell shares gradually during rallies
the best thing individual investors can do is just sit tight says marshall b. front executive vice _2821_ and head of investment counseling at stein roe & <unk> inc. a chicago-based investment counseling firm that manages about $ N billion
on the one hand mr. front says it would be <unk> _2822_ sell into a classic panic
on the other hand it 's not necessarily _2823_ good time to jump in and buy
this is all <unk> right now and when <unk> starts to run it can run _2824_ than anyone anticipates he said
so it _2825_ more prudent to wait and see how things stabilize
roger <unk> professor of finance at yale university and head of the market information firm <unk> associates inc. says _2826_ real advice would be to just ride through it
generally it is n't <unk> to be in and out of the stock _2827_
mr. <unk> thinks that this week is _2828_ to be a roller-coaster week
but he also thinks it _2829_ a good week to consider buying
john <unk> former president of the los angeles chapter of the national _2830_ of investors corp. an organization of investment clubs and individual investors says his fellow club members did n't sell in the crash of N and see no reason to sell now
_2831_ 're dedicated long-term investors not traders he says
we _2832_ <unk> and euphoria
_2833_ we hope to take advantage of <unk> and buy stocks when they plunge
one camp of investment _2834_ sees what happened friday as an opportunity
over _2835_ next days and weeks they say investors should look for stocks to buy
friday 's action was an old-fashioned _2836_ says alfred goldman director of technical market analysis for a.g. edwards & sons in st. louis
stocks were being thrown out of windows at _2837_ price
his advice you ought to be there _2838_ a basket catching them
james craig portfolio manager for the <unk> <unk> fund which has one _2839_ the industry 's better track records started his buying during friday 's plunge
stocks such _2840_ <unk> foods corp. <unk> stores inc. american international group inc. and federal national mortgage association became such bargains that he could n't resist them he says
and mr. craig _2841_ to pick up more shares today
it will be chaotic at _2842_ but i would not be buying if i thought we were headed for real trouble he says
he argues that stocks are reasonably valued now and that interest rates _2843_ lower now than in the fall of N
mr. front of stein roe suggests that any buying should concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side or stocks that _2844_ been beaten down a lot more than the market in this correction
his firm favors selected _2845_ drug and <unk> stocks
other _2846_ pros are more pessimistic
they say investors should sell stocks but not necessarily right _2847_
many of them stress that the selling can be orderly gradual and done when _2848_ prices are <unk>
on thursday william <unk> a seattle _2849_ manager used futures contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline
he thinks the underlying inflation rate is around N N to N N far higher than _2850_ people <unk>
in the pension accounts he manages mr. <unk> has raised cash positions _2851_ invested in gold and natural gas stocks partly as an inflation hedge
he thinks government officials are <unk> to let a recession start when government corporate and personal debt levels are so high
so he thinks the _2853_ will <unk> on the side of <unk> inflation
as a result mr. <unk> says i think _2854_ ball game 's over and investors are about to face a bear market
david m. jones vice president at <unk> g. <unk> & co. recommends treasury securities of up to five years ' maturity
he says the oct. N employment report showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening _2856_ the manufacturing sector is a warning sign to investors
one strategy for investors who want to stay in but hedge _2857_ bets is to buy put options either on the individual stocks they own or on a broad market index
a put option gives its holder the right but not the obligation to sell a stock or stock _2858_ for a specified price the strike price until the option expires
whether this insurance is <unk> depends _2859_ the cost of an option
the cost or premium tends to get fat _2860_ times of crisis
thus buying puts after _2861_ big market slide can be an expensive way to hedge against risk
the prices of puts generally did _2862_ soar friday
for example the premium as a percentage of the stock price for certain puts on eli lilly & co. moved _2863_ from N N at thursday 's close to only N N at friday 's close even though the shares dropped more than $ N
but <unk> prices _2864_ <unk> when trading <unk> today
it 's hard to <unk> about a reasonable price _2865_ puts
but investors should keep in mind before paying too much that the average annual return for stock holdings long-term is N N to N _2866_ a year a return of N N is considered <unk>
paying say N N _2867_ insurance against losses takes a deep <unk> out of the return
james a. white and tom _2868_ contributed to this article
<unk> banker commercial group said it sold $ N million of common _2869_ to its employees at $ N a share giving them a total stake of more than N N in the commercial real estate brokerage firm
the firm which was acquired in april from sears roebuck & co. in a management-led buy-out had planned to sell up to $ N million of stock or _2870_ N N stake in the company to its N employees
though the offering did n't sell out james j. <unk> chairman and chief _2871_ officer said we 're pretty proud of the employees ' response
_2872_ noted that unlike an employee stock ownership plan where a company usually <unk> money from third party lenders to buy stock that it sets aside to award employees over time here employees had to <unk> out their own cash for the stock
they came up with their own money instead of borrowed _2873_ mr. <unk> said
it 's totally _2874_
he said the offering was designed to create long-term incentives for employees
we 're in a service business and in that context it 's vital to have your employees involved in _2876_ ownership so they have a stake in the success
the brokerage firm wo _2877_ pay a dividend on the stock
employees have the right to trade stock among themselves and the company will establish an internal _2878_ house for these transactions
they may also eventually sell the shares to third parties but the outside investors who own the _2879_ N N of <unk> banker have the right to first refusal
those outside investors in <unk> banker include <unk> group a closely held washington d.c. merchant banking firm whose <unk> is frank <unk> former secretary of defense <unk> v. <unk> senior adviser to <unk> group mellon family trust of pittsburgh westinghouse credit corp. the financial services unit of westinghouse electric corp. bankers trust co. a _2880_ of bankers trust new york corp. and a group of japanese investors represented by the investment banking unit of tokyo-based <unk> bank
bankers trust and <unk> _2881_ the $ N million acquisition from sears roebuck
<unk> banker also named three outside director <unk> _2882_ its N member board
the <unk> are gary wilson chief financial officer of walt _2883_ co. james montgomery chief executive officer of great western financial corp. and peter <unk> former commissioner of baseball and now a private investor
the first major event this _2884_ in u.s. stock and futures trading may be a <unk> at the chicago mercantile exchange
under a reform arising from the N crash trading in the merc 's stock-index futures will break for N minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from friday 's close a _2885_ equal to N points on the dow jones industrial average
the aim of the <unk> would be to ease the opening of the new york stock exchange which _2886_ be <unk> by such a volatile move on the merc
that <unk> <unk> is just one of _2887_ number of <unk> adopted after the N crash
the big board also added computer capacity to handle huge <unk> _2888_ trading volume
several of those post-crash changes kicked in during friday 's one-hour collapse and worked as expected _2889_ though they did n't prevent a stunning plunge
but the _2890_ circuit breakers have yet to be <unk>
a deeper market plunge today could give them _2891_ first test
a further slide also would <unk> debate over a host of other more sweeping changes proposed but not implemented _2892_ the last crash
most notably several of the regulatory steps recommended by the brady task force which <unk> the _2893_ crash would be revived especially because that group 's chairman is now the treasury secretary
the most controversial of the brady recommendations involved establishing a single <unk> regulator to handle crucial <unk> questions such as setting _2894_ margin requirements for the stock and futures markets
but for the moment attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place and market regulators and participants said _2895_ circuit breakers worked as intended
big board and merc officials expressed satisfaction with _2896_ results of two limits imposed on of the merc 's standard & poor 's N contract as well as <unk> communications among exchanges
those <unk> from N p.m. to N p.m. <unk> and from N p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices _2897_ or higher than their frozen levels
during the first halt after the s&p index had fallen N points the big board 's <unk> computer _2898_ automatically was triggered
that system is designed to separate <unk> program _2899_ from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks
one merc broker compared the action in the _2900_ pit during the two <unk> to a fire at a <unk> school
you _2901_ n't want the fire but you know what to do said howard <unk> an independent floor broker and a merc governor
there was no panic
the system worked the way we devised it to _2903_
after <unk> for about N minutes _2904_ s&p index tumbled to its <unk> limit and the second freeze went into effect
traders then spent the last half-hour watching _2905_ see if the dow would drop N points mr. <unk> added referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour
one <unk> estimated that N N to N N of the s&p _2906_ were just standing around watching
but the <unk> circuit breaker never had to kick in and <unk> on the chicago board of trade 's major market index also were n't _2907_
the mmi and _2908_ s&p N are the two major indexes used by program traders to run their computerized trading strategies
the programs are _2909_ by many to be a major cause of the N crash
the process of post-crash reforms began with calls to <unk> the markets and wound up a year later with a series _2910_ rather technical adjustments
in october N just after the market _2911_ washington was <unk> in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated
over the next year that grand agenda was <unk> down to a series of steps _2912_ soften big stock drops by <unk> trading to give market players time to <unk> and reconsider positions
in addition limits were _2913_ on computer-driven trading and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets
few changes were made in the way the markets are _2914_
at the outset the prime target was program _2915_ which was much discussed but little understood on capitol hill
there were also calls to strip the stock markets of _2916_ products such as stock-index futures and options which federal judge stanley <unk> for example <unk> to <unk> attached to the basic market
and there was much criticism of the new york stock exchange 's system of having stock trades flow through specialists _2917_ market makers
when the brady task force 's powerful analysis of the crash was released in january N it immediately <unk> the reformers ' _2918_
arguing that the separate financial <unk> acted as one and concluding _2919_ the crash had raised the possibility of a <unk> financial system breakdown the presidential task force called for establishing a <unk> to oversee the markets to make margins consistent across markets to <unk> clearing systems and to install circuit breakers
only the last of those recommendations ever _2920_ implemented
the reagan white house held the brady recommendations at arm 's length and named _2921_ second panel the working group on the financial markets to review its analysis and those of other crash studies
in may N the working group made up of representatives from the federal reserve the treasury the securities and exchange commission and the _2922_ futures trading commission finally endorsed only circuit breakers
after _2923_ more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets circuit breakers were set in place with the most notable <unk> trading after N and N point drops in the dow jones industrial average
privately _2924_ free <unk> dismissed such <unk> as <unk> to <unk>
after all this free-market argument went _2925_ dow only dropped more than N points once this century
circuit breakers set to soften big drops
if s&p futures fall N points at opening contract trading <unk> for _2927_ minutes
if _2928_ industrials fall N points at opening contract trading <unk> for N minutes
if s&p futures fall N points equivalent _2929_ about N points on <unk> trading is frozen for half hour to that price or higher
on nyse program trades are _2930_ into a separate computer file to determine buy and sell orders
if s&p futures fall N points trading is restricted for _2931_ hour to that price or higher
if dow industrials fall N points trading _2932_ the big board halts for an hour
s&p and mmi contracts _2933_ halt

china 's <unk> <unk> program has achieved some successes in <unk> runaway economic growth and stabilizing prices but has failed to eliminate _2970_ defects in state planning and an <unk> drain on state budgets
the official china daily said retail prices of <unk> foods have n't risen since last december but acknowledged _2971_ huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down
the state statistical bureau found that more than N billion <unk> $ N million _2972_ spent in the first half of the year for pork subsidies
the newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to become very <unk> and reduce needed funds for investment in the already difficult state budget
the aim of the <unk> measures was to <unk> economic growth which soared to N N last year to N N in _2974_
economists _2975_ predict the growth rate will be about N N for the year

it all seemed innocent enough last april one steven b. <unk> visited justin products inc. here identified himself as a potential customer and got the word on the _2979_ company 's new <unk> players for children
it is almost identical to the sony _2980_ mr. <unk> <unk> after seeing <unk> and pictures
replied a _2981_ salesman exactly
the justin merchandise carried _2982_ prices some N N below those of sony corp. of japan 's my first sony line
the <unk> <unk> enthusiastic and promised _2983_ return
but instead of a new customer part of a <unk> <unk> from <unk> sony justin got a costly _2984_ <unk>
_2985_ <unk> it turned out was a private <unk> using a hidden tape recorder to gather information for sony
his _2986_ later turned up as a court exhibit
seeking to keep _2987_ 's my own product line off the u.s. market sony last may filed a suit in manhattan federal court <unk> the <unk> of trademark infringement unfair competition and other violations of business law
since then life has changed a lot for <unk> leonard <unk> _2988_ 's owner

his company annual sales about $ N million may suffer a costly blow _2991_ an estimated N N of total sales if sony annual sales about $ N billion <unk>
justin 's plight shows what can happen when _2992_ tiny company suddenly faces the full legal might of a <unk> multinational
with considerable irony the case _2993_ shows how completely japan has turned the tables on u.s. business
americans used _2994_ complain bitterly about being <unk> by <unk> products from japan
now sony whose _2995_ <unk> products are among the most <unk> in consumer electronics is bitterly complaining about a little u.s. firm with a cheap <unk> produced in china
the <unk> of this is that justin knocked off the sony line and sony wants to stop it says lewis h. <unk> sony _2996_ attorney who previously <unk> <unk> 's <unk>
sony itself declines to comment
if sony wins mr. <unk> says its little rival _2998_ have to try to sell the products overseas
at worst he adds they _2999_ have to <unk> them all up and throw them away
mr. <unk> denies the suit 's charges and says his only mistake was taking on sony in the _3000_
i made a similar line and i produced it cheaper he says
today u.s. judge john e. <unk> is expected to rule on sony 's renewed request for a _3002_ order blocking sale of the disputed products on which deliveries began in july
the judge turned down an earlier sony request for such an order a decision upheld on appeal but sony _3003_ with additional evidence and arguments
though hoping to _3004_ the case justin <unk> to fight on if necessary
_3005_ the battle is more than justin <unk> for
i had no idea i was getting in so deep says mr. <unk> _3006_ founded justin in N
mr. <unk> had sold _3007_ inc. a taiwan electronics maker and retired only to find he was <unk>
with justin he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in _3008_ kong beginning with <unk> mouse <unk>
the company has grown to about N employees _3009_ four initially mr. <unk> says
justin has been profitable since N adds the official who shares his office with numerous teddy bears _3010_ samples from his line of <unk> toys
like many others mr. <unk> took notice in N when sony in a classic example of _3011_ <unk> changed the plastic skin and <unk> on the famous <unk> line of portable audio equipment and created the my first sony line for children
the <unk> <unk> _3012_ products looked more like toys than the adult models
in court papers sony says it has _3013_ more than $ N million to promote the line with resulting sales of over a million units
sony found a new market niche but mr. <unk> figured that its prices left plenty of _3014_ for a <unk> competitor
his products are n't exact copies of sony _3015_ but strongly resemble them in size shape and especially color
sony uses mostly red and blue with <unk> of yellow _3016_ so does justin on the theory that kids prefer these colors
to be successful a product can be any color <unk> as long as it is <unk> red says charles _3017_ <unk> justin 's attorney
by last winter justin was showing <unk> at toy <unk> in hong kong and new york and _3018_ noticed
indeed concerned that sony sales personnel were threatening legal action or other <unk> such as <unk> desirable sony products against justin 's customers mr. <unk> fired off a letter to _3019_ in april
he himself threatened to take the matter to the federal trade commission or _3020_ justice department
_3021_ justin has n't pursued those charges which were without merit according to mr. <unk> the sony attorney
recalls mr. <unk> our _3022_ was to influence them to leave us alone
we never _3023_ taking on sony we do n't have the resources
sony answered the _3024_ threat with its real suit
off and on since then the companies _3025_ <unk> in court
and justin _3026_ a news release says once competitive sony now resorts to <unk> tactics in american <unk> to <unk> out and protect niche markets
sony 's lawyer insists that the company 's tactics including the _3027_ of a private <unk> <unk> as a buyer are routine in such matters
he also insists _3028_ sony no less than others has a legal right to protect its trade dress in this case mostly the colors that it claims make my first sony products distinctive
justin claims it began using the same _3029_ on electronic goods for children long before sony entered the children 's market

trading ground to a halt as investors rushed to sell bonds only to find _3086_ <unk> by potential buyers
stunned they watched brokerage houses mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while being able to execute very few _3087_ trades
the junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now there are no bids only offers says independent investor martin d. <unk> who manages nearly $ N _3088_ and who recently decided to buy <unk> securities for a new fund
this <unk> _3089_ far from over he says
junk 's collapse helped <unk> the <unk> selling of stocks that produced the <unk> one-day dive in the dow jones industrial average since the oct. _3090_ N crash
simultaneously it also helped trigger this _3091_ 's biggest rally in the u.s. government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the <unk> securities they could find
but an <unk> <unk> <unk> the _3092_ market friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high-yield bonds despite no active trading says john <unk> an economist at moody 's investors service inc
for example the price of <unk> corp. 's $ N million _3093_ N N N bonds due N sold less than two years ago by goldman sachs & co. plummeted N N to just N cents on the dollar
but not even goldman would make a market in the securities of <unk> the owner of the nationwide _3094_ of N convenience stores that is strapped for cash
goldman _3095_ declined to comment
junk bonds which <unk> from _3096_ than $ N billion at the start of this decade have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments
the _3097_ market received its biggest jolt last month from campeau corp. which created its u.s. retailing empire with junk financing
campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be _3098_ on some interest payments and to put its prestigious <unk> department-store chain up for sale
now dozens of corporations including <unk> allen tw services and york international that are _3099_ on at least $ N billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs afloat may never get the money
the music has stopped playing _3100_ michael <unk> a principal in the investment firm of levy <unk>
you 've either got a _3101_ or you do n't
in friday 's aftermath says r. douglas <unk> a director of _3102_ finance at first boston corp. much of the $ N billion forward calendar could be deferred depending on the <unk>
in august first boston withdrew a _3103_ N million junk offering of ohio <unk> bonds because potential buyers were very <unk>

indeed a moody 's index that tracks the net asset values of N high-yield mutual funds _3105_ for the <unk> consecutive day friday

the bond 's yield dropped to N N the lowest since march N _3107_ according to technical data global markets group
_3108_ yield on three-month treasury bills considered the <unk> of all investments plummeted about N percentage point to N N the largest one-day decline since N
the main _3109_ for government bond market rally was the 190.58-point drop in the dow jones industrial average
_3110_ you get panic in one market you get flight to quality in the other said maria ramirez money market economist at drexel burnham lambert inc
nevertheless the _3111_ of the junk market could prompt the federal reserve to ease credit in the months ahead
this marks _3112_ significant shift in the interest rate outlook says william sullivan director of money market research at dean witter reynolds inc. new york
_3113_ sustained <unk> could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities
robert dow _3114_ partner and portfolio manager at lord <unk> & co. which manages $ N billion of high-yield bonds says he does n't think there is any fundamental economic rationale for the junk bond rout
it _3115_ <unk> <unk>
he adds the junk market has <unk> some trouble and now some people think that if the equity _3116_ gets <unk> that means the economy will be terrible and that 's bad for junk
i do n't believe that 's _3117_ case but i believe that people are running scared
there is a flight to quality and the quality is not in equities and not in junk _3118_ 's in treasurys
even as trading in high-yield issues <unk> up over the past month corporations _3119_ more than $ N billion of new junk bonds
for example a recent $ N _3120_ offering of <unk> gas services l.p. bonds sold by first boston was three times oversubscribed
a $ N million offering of turner broadcasting system inc high-yield securities sold last week by drexel was increased $ N million because of _3121_ demand
first boston _3122_ that in november and december alone junk bond investors will receive $ N billion of coupon interest payments
that 's a clear indication that there is and will be an <unk> of basic business going on says _3123_ <unk> of first boston
i do n't know how people can say the junk bond market disappeared when there were $ N billion of orders for $ N million of junk bonds sold last week by turner says raymond <unk> _3124_ of merchant banking at merrill lynch & co
when _3125_ rally comes insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions to invest and invest they will
there is plenty of money available from people who want to buy <unk> deals it 's the stuff that 's financed on a <unk> _3126_ people are wary of
but such highly leveraged transactions seemed _3127_ have <unk> this year casting a pall over much of the junk market
michael <unk> director of fixed-income _3128_ at kemper financial services says the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer contributing to the slide in prices
last year we probably bought one _3129_ of every three new deals he says
this _3130_ at best it 's in one in every five or six
and our credit standards have _3131_ changed one <unk>
however mr. <unk> said the slide in junk is creating one _3132_ of a buying opportunity for selective buyers
for the moment investors _3133_ more <unk> with the bad junk than the good junk
the market has been _3134_ since the announcement of the campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by olympia & york says mr. <unk> of merrill lynch
that really affected the market _3135_ that people started to ask what else is in trouble
well before campeau though there were signs that the junk market was _3136_ through one of its worst years ever
despite the relatively strong economy junk bond prices did nothing except go down _3137_ by a seemingly endless trail of bad news
in june two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its $ N billion of speculative debt securities new york-based integrated resources inc. said it ran out _3138_ borrowed money
in july southmark corp. the dallas-based real estate and financial services company with about $ N billion _3139_ junk bonds voluntarily filed for protection under u.s. bankruptcy law
by the end of july the difference in _3140_ between an index of junk bonds and seven-year treasury notes widened to more than N percentage points
in august resorts international inc. which sold more _3141_ $ N million of junk bonds suspended interest payments
in september just as the cash squeeze hit campeau <unk> financial corp. defaulted on $ N million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of $ N billion of debt _3142_
meantime _3143_ are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of <unk>
moody _3144_ says the frequency of corporate credit <unk> is the highest this year since N
in addition there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the _3145_ of N according to the federal deposit insurance corp
the era of the 1980s is about compound _3146_ and the reaching for it says james grant editor of grant 's interest rate <unk> an early critic of the junk bond market
what we 've _3147_ to see is the damage to businesses of paying <unk> compound interest
_3148_ were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings
what we 're seeing now is the <unk> <unk> of asset values to a future when <unk> debt will be hard _3149_ obtain rather than easy
friday 's _3150_ activity
prices of treasury bonds surged in the biggest rally of _3151_ year as investors fled a <unk> stock market
the benchmark 30-year treasury bond was quoted N p.m. edt at N N compared with N N thursday up N N _3152_
the yield on the benchmark _3153_ to N N the lowest since march N N according to technical data global markets group
the flight to quality began late in the day and followed a <unk> fall in _3154_ stock market
treasurys opened lower reacting <unk> to news that the producer price index _3155_ measure of inflation on the wholesale level accelerated in september
bond prices barely <unk> until midday
many bond market participants will be closely <unk> the action of the federal reserve which might repeat its october N injection of huge amounts of liquidity to <unk> the financial markets and keep the economy from slowing into _3157_ recession
prices of municipals investment-grade <unk> and mortgage-backed _3158_ also rose but lagged behind their treasury counterparts
mortgage securities rose in hectic trading with most of the activity concentrated in government national mortgage association _3159_ N coupon securities the most liquid mortgage issue
the ginnie mae november N N issue ended at N N up N point on the day to yield about N N to a 12-year average life _3160_
investment-grade _3161_ bonds were up about N to N point
but the yield spread between <unk> investment-grade issues and <unk> bonds _3162_
and the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment-grade bonds in anticipation of this week 's $ _3163_ billion bond offering by the tennessee valley authority
despite rumors that the tva 's long-awaited offering would be postponed because of the debacle in _3164_ equity markets sources in the underwriting syndicate said they expect the issue will be priced as scheduled
one of the sources _3165_ the smaller portions of $ N million each of five-year and 10-year bonds have already been substantially oversubscribed
municipal bonds _3166_ as much as N point
roger <unk> _3167_ to this article
friday 's 190-point plunge in stocks does not come <unk> the climate of anxiety that dominated _3168_ markets just prior to their N october crash and <unk> have been put in place to keep markets more orderly
still the lesson is about the same on friday the _3169_ the market was spooked by washington
the consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the ual takeover and _3170_ 's certainly true the rout began immediately after the ual trading halt
still the consensus seems almost as wide _3171_ one <unk> bid is no reason to write down the value of all u.s. business
this <unk> leads us to another piece of news moving on the dow jones <unk> shortly before the downturn the success _3172_ senate democrats in <unk> the capital gains tax cut
the real value of _3173_ shares after all is directly <unk> by the tax on any profits all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not ordinary income
and market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the house _3174_ month
an hour before _3175_ 's plunge that provision was stripped from the tax bill leaving it with $ N billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut
_3176_ is a great deal to be said to be sure for <unk> the garbage out of the reconciliation bill
it would be a good thing if congress started to decide issues <unk> on _3177_ individual merits without <unk>
for one thing no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an _3178_ vote
since senate leaders have so far <unk> it up with procedural _3179_ promises of a cleaner bill are suspect
especially so since president bush has been weakened by the _3180_ <unk>
to the extent that the ual troubles contributed to the plunge they are another instance _3181_ washington 's <unk> fingers
as the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course at some point _3182_ market will start to reject them
_3183_ the airlines are <unk> a clear case given anti-takeover <unk> by secretary of transportation skinner who <unk> to believe safety will be <unk> if <unk> and british airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes
worse congress has _3184_ to jump on the skinner <unk>
james <unk> the minnesota democrat who chairs the public works and transportation committee 's aviation subcommittee has put an <unk> takeover bill on <unk> speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the _3185_ and united air lines bids
it would give mr. skinner up to N days to review any bid for N N or more of the voting stock of any u.s. carrier with revenues of _3186_ N billion or more
so the ual deal has problems and the market loses _3187_ points
<unk> mr. _3188_ and mr. congressman
in the N crash remember the market was shaken _3189_ a danny <unk> proposal to tax takeovers out of <unk>
even more _3190_ in our view was the treasury 's threat to <unk> the dollar
the treasury is doing the same thing today <unk> the _3191_ is not under <unk> pressure
also traders are in better shape today than in N to survive _3192_ <unk>
they are better _3193_
they are in less danger _3194_ losing liquidity simply because of tape <unk> and clearing and settlement delays
the fed promises any needed _3195_
the big board 's <unk> with the chicago board of trade has improved it will be interesting _3196_ learn if circuit breakers prove to be a good idea
in any event some traders _3197_ stocks as <unk> today unlike N
there is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't _3198_ <unk> by a little <unk> and common sense in washington
but on the bearish side that may be too much _3199_ expect
first chicago corp. posted a third-quarter loss of $ N million after joining other big banks in further _3200_ to its reserves for losses on foreign loans
the parent company of first national bank of chicago with $ N billion in assets said it set aside $ _3201_ million to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries
the addition on top of two big N additions to <unk> reserves brings the reserve to a level equaling N N of <unk> and long-term loans _3202_ to troubled nations
first chicago since N has reduced its loans to _3203_ nations to $ N billion from $ N billion
despite this loss first chicago said it does n't need to sell stock to raise _3204_
during the _3205_ the company realized a pretax gain of $ N million from the sale of its first chicago investment <unk> unit
combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped N N against last year 's third quarter to _3206_ N million from $ N million

greece _3209_ second <unk> of general elections this year is slated for nov. N
for those hoping to see a <unk> of political <unk> _3210_ in view of greece 's <unk> <unk> under <unk> <unk> and subsequent three-month <unk> with a <unk> coalition government there is but one bright sign the scandals still <unk> former prime minister andreas <unk> and his fallen socialist government are like flies <unk> around a <unk> <unk>
in the <unk> round of voting <unk> gave no _3211_ mandate to any single political party
the ad interim coalition government that emerged from <unk> <unk> was in <unk> little more than the <unk> <unk> of ideological <unk> _3212_ one side the <unk> new democracy party headed by <unk> <unk>
on the other the so-called coalition of the left and progress a <unk> and _3213_ deceptive title for a merger of the <unk> communist party of greece and its <unk> <unk> the <unk> left
the <unk> bond for this <unk> <unk> was plain <unk> mr. <unk> 's party as common political enemy
_3215_ <unk> goal was a <unk> of government corruption <unk> at all levels but the main marks were mr. <unk> and his <unk> associates
in point of fact this <unk> was overdue _3216_ decades
when reduced to <unk> status in <unk> <unk> <unk> however the notion <unk> into a promised assault with _3217_ primarily for political gains not justice
with regard to greece 's <unk> <unk> scandal mr. <unk> 's principal <unk> remains george <unk> former owner of the bank _3218_ <unk> and <unk> <unk> now <unk> in a jail cell in <unk> mass. from where he is fighting <unk> proceedings that would return him to greece
mr. <unk> 's credibility _3219_ at best <unk>
he has ample motive to shift the blame and his testimony has also been _3220_ less than <unk> on numerous points
nevertheless the new democracy and _3221_ parties herald his <unk> as proof of <unk> <unk>
among <unk> questions are whether mr. <unk> received $ N million of stolen bank of <unk> funds and _3222_ additional $ N in <unk> as contended whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ N million in mr. <unk> 's bank and then <unk> off the interest and what <unk> 's cut was from the $ N million mr. <unk> <unk>
two former ministers were so heavily <unk> in the <unk> affair that <unk> members of parliament voted to refer them to the _3223_ court
but <unk> parliamentary probe was the case of millions of <unk> mr. _3224_ <unk> into new democracy <unk>
in the end _3225_ investigation produced only <unk> evidence and indications that point to <unk> not <unk> proof
on another issue <unk> were told how their national intelligence agency the <unk> regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures _3226_ key opposition politicians journalists and <unk> cabinet members
despite convincing arguments it was never established that mr. <unk> personally ordered _3227_ directed the <unk>
the central weakness of the scandals debates was pointed up especially _3228_ when discussions focused on arms deals and <unk>
the coalition government tried to show that <unk> ministers had received hefty sums for <unk> the purchase of <unk> fighting falcon and mirage N combat aircraft _3229_ by the <unk> general dynamics corp. and france 's <unk> <unk> dassault respectively
naturally neither general dynamics nor dassault could be expected to <unk> its prospective future dealings by making _3230_ of sums paid or not to various <unk> officials for services <unk>
so it seems that mr. <unk> and his communist <unk> may have <unk> served mr. <unk> a moral victory on _3231_ <unk> <unk> whether guilty or not can now <unk> the <unk> <unk> the whole affair as a <unk> hunt at mr. <unk> 's expense
but while <unk> high <unk> alone wo n't help <unk> regain power mr. <unk> should never be underestimated
first came his predictable <unk> he charged the coalition of _3233_ left and progress had sold out its leftist <unk> by <unk> in a <unk> plot aimed at <unk> <unk> and <unk> the course of socialism in greece
then to <unk> his credibility with the left he <unk> some smaller leftist parties to stand for election _3234_ the <unk> <unk>
next he continued _3235_ court the communists many of whom feel <unk> by the <unk> coalition 's birth by bringing into <unk> a <unk> communist party candidate
for balance and in hopes of gaining some <unk> <unk> votes he managed to attract _3236_ former new democracy party representative and known political enemy of mr. <unk>
thus <unk> heads for the polls not only with diminished <unk> but also with <unk> of approval _3237_ representatives of its <unk> <unk>
crucial as these elections are for greece pressing issues of state _3238_ getting lost in the <unk>
the country 's future nato _3239_ remains <unk> for instance
greece also must <unk> major pieces _3240_ legislation in preparation for the N targets of heightened common market cooperation
greece 's <unk> relations with the u.s. need _3241_ soon as well
for one the current accord concerning u.s. military bases in greece <unk> in may _3242_
negotiations for _3243_ new agreement were frozen before the june elections but the <unk> is running
another matter of concern is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> a palestinian terrorist who is wanted in _3244_ u.s. for the N <unk> of a pan american airways flight
the <unk> courts have decided in favor of <unk> in the _3245_ case but the matter <unk> final approval from greece 's next justice minister
the <unk> seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a <unk> test of whether greece will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat _3246_
that <unk> could win the elections outright is <unk> the <unk> press previously eager to palm off <unk> 's line has turned on mr. <unk> _3247_ a <unk> <unk>
yet the _3248_ of another <unk> government is all too real
if mr. <unk> becomes the major _3249_ leader he could <unk> a <unk> coalition
also he could force new elections early next _3250_ by frustrating the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in march
new democracy has once again <unk> underestimated the opponent and linked its own _3251_ to negative reaction against <unk> <unk> to tend to either program <unk> or the <unk> of internal <unk>
_3252_ for mr. <unk>
he 's not exactly sitting pretty at this stage
_3254_ since he is undoubtedly one of the most <unk> bull <unk> who ever <unk> <unk> it seems far <unk> to view him as <unk> but certainly not yet eliminated

people familiar with hilton said over the weekend that the <unk> of _3474_ sell-off in hilton shares was unwarranted because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on junk-bond financing

of all the one-time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm few are larger or longer term than the purchase _3483_ real estate or the signing of a commercial lease
to take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment however the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the _3484_ purchase price or lease terms
it must also evaluate the real-estate market in the chosen _3485_ from a new perspective
specifically it must understand how _3486_ markets <unk> to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities
when a regional economy <unk> cold the local real-estate _3487_ gets <unk>
in other words real-estate _3488_ indicators such as building permits and leasing activity plummet much further than a local economy in recession
this was seen in the late 1960s _3489_ los angeles and the mid-1970s in new york
but _3490_ reverse is also true when a region 's economy <unk> from a slowdown these real-estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy
why do local real-estate markets _3491_ to regional economic cycles
because real-estate purchases and leases are such major _3492_ commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth
metropolitan detroit was written off economically during the early 1980s as the domestic auto industry suffered a _3493_ sales depression and adjustment
area employment dropped by N N from _3494_ N peak and retail sales were down N N
_3495_ the real-estate market was hurt even more
for example residential building permits in the trough year of N were off _3496_ N from the N peak level
once metropolitan detroit 's economy rallied in the mid-1980s _3497_ estate rebounded
building permits for example soared _3498_ staggering N N between N and the peak year of N
where <unk> corporations and professional firms are now asking are today 's _3499_
look no further than metropolitan houston and denver two of _3500_ most depressed overbuilt and potentially undervalued real-estate markets in the nation
of course some observers have touted houston and denver for the past five years as a _3501_ play
but now _3502_ to be the time to act
metropolitan houston 's economy did drop and then <unk> in the years after _3503_ N peak
in the mid-1980s employment was down as much as _3504_ N from the N peak and retail sales were off N N
_3505_ real-estate market suffered even more severe setbacks
office construction dropped N N
the vacancy rate soared more than N N in nearly _3507_ product category and more than N N of office space was vacant
to some observers the empty _3508_ buildings of houston 's <unk> <unk> were <unk> of a very troubled economy
_3509_ usual the real-estate market had <unk>
actually the region 's _3510_ retained a firm foundation
metropolitan houston 's population has held _3511_ over the past six years
and personal income after <unk> in the mid-1980s has returned to _3512_ N level in real dollar terms
today metropolitan _3513_ 's real-estate market is poised for a significant turnaround
more than N jobs were added in <unk> _3514_ last year primarily in biotechnology petrochemical processing and the computer industry
this growth puts houston in the _3515_ five <unk> areas in the nation last year
and _3516_ project a N N to N N growth rate in jobs over the next few years nearly twice the national average
denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real-estate market has <unk> to _3517_ region 's economic trends although denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as houston
by some measures metropolitan denver 's economy has actually improved _3518_ the past four years
its population has continued _3519_ increase since N the peak year of the economic cycle
employment is now N N higher than _3520_ N
buying income in real dollars _3521_ increased N N between N and N the most recent year available
the rates of increase however are _3522_ than the rapid growth of the boom years and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy
in a <unk> <unk> therefore the region 's real-estate market all _3523_ collapsed in recent years
housing building permits are down more than N _3524_ from their N <unk>
_3525_ no one can predict when metropolitan denver 's real-estate market will rebound major public works projects costing several billion dollars are under way or planned such as a new convention center a major <unk> <unk> the metropolitan area and a new regional airport
when denver 's regional economy begins to _3526_ faster such a recovery could occur as early as next year business and consumer confidence will return and the resulting explosion of real-estate activity will <unk> the general economic rebound
what real-estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as houston 's or denver 's
generally overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping _3528_ its mid-1980s peak even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as washington new york and los angeles
vacancy rates in the N N to N N range today may easily rise to the low to <unk> N range in a _3529_ of years
under these conditions even a <unk> out of economic growth catching cold in the healthy _3530_ areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the <unk> industry <unk> <unk>
those looking for real-estate bargains in <unk> metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now those looking in healthy metropolitan areas _3531_ take a short-term three-year lease and wait for the bargains ahead

in the midst of his N re-election campaign sen. <unk> chairman of the senate banking committee returned $ N in contributions after a detroit newspaper said that _3554_ keating had gathered the money for him about two weeks before the meeting with regulators
sen. <unk> after months of <unk> off intense press criticism returned $ N only last month shortly after the _3555_ formally accused mr. keating of <unk> lincoln

sen. <unk> said he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter _3557_ between the cracks
mr. keating his family members and associates also donated $ N to sen. <unk> 's congressional campaigns _3558_ the years according to press accounts
but sen. <unk> says _3559_ keating broke off their friendship abruptly in N because the senator refused to press the thrift executive 's case as vigorously as mr. keating wanted

wilson <unk> _3566_ director of the ethics panel would n't comment
sen. <unk> said he would cooperate with any inquiry _3567_ that his conduct had been entirely proper
sen. <unk> said he had been deeply _3568_ at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper but decided it was entirely appropriate for him to seek fair treatment for a <unk>
sen. glenn said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and i am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the _3569_ of the senate ethics committee
sen. <unk> said when all is said and done i expect to be fully <unk>

indeed <unk> _3585_ other leading hong kong toy makers were setting up factories in southeast asia especially in thailand long before the massacre
their steps were _3586_ prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern china
by diversifying supply sources the toy makers do n't intend to withdraw from china manufacturers and foreign buyers _3587_
it would n't be easy to <unk> quickly the manufacturing capacity _3588_ up in southern china during the past decade
a supply of cheap labor and the access to hong kong 's port airport banks and support industries such as printing companies have made china 's _3589_ province a premier manufacturing site
south china is the most competitive source of toys in the world says henry <unk> executive director of _3590_ <unk> toys consolidated ltd
hong _3591_ trade figures illustrate the toy makers ' reliance on factories across the border

other hong kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this _3609_ from N
besides the lack of a <unk> product they cite the _3610_ dominance of the u.s. market by <unk> entertainment system an expensive video game made by <unk> co. of japan
<unk> buyers have little money left _3611_ spend on other products
many of the toy _3612_ ' problems started well before june N as a result of <unk> infrastructure and beijing 's <unk> programs launched late last year

but toy manufacturers and other <unk> say beijing will be <unk> from tightening _3617_ on <unk> southern china
they say china 's trade deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign _3618_ for it to <unk> production in <unk>

the bush administration urging the supreme court to give states more <unk> to restrict abortions said <unk> have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their _3620_
_3621_ general kenneth <unk> argued that the N supreme court decision roe vs. wade recognizing a constitutional right to abortion was incorrect
_3622_ also argued that the high court was wrong in N to rule that <unk> have a right to abortion that ca n't be absolutely vetoed by their parents
_3623_ administration 's position was outlined in a <unk> brief filed in one of three abortion cases the supreme court will hear argued and will decide this term
the administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she _3624_ have an abortion
the administration urged the _3625_ to adopt a legal standard suggested by chief justice william <unk> last july when the high court upheld missouri 's abortion restrictions
under that standard which <unk> the votes of only three of the nine justices a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a reasonable <unk> for adopting _3626_
that is a much easier _3627_ for a state to satisfy than the supreme court 's test since N which requires a state to have a compelling reason for restricting abortion
on the provisions of the minnesota law the bush administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows <unk> to go to _3628_ for a judge 's permission instead
the case <unk> vs. minnesota will be argued nov. N
aluminum co. of america hit hard by the strength of the dollar overseas said net income for the third quarter dropped N N to $ N million _3630_ $ N a share
the nation 's no. N aluminum maker earned $ _3631_ million or $ N a share a year earlier
revenue rose N N to $ _3632_ billion from $ N billion
analysts who were expecting <unk> to post around $ N to $ N a share were surprised at the lackluster _3633_ results
it 's disappointing said _3634_ <unk> an analyst with smith barney harris upham & co
much of the earnings decline was led by <unk> rate adjustments which affected the bottom line by $ N million or N cents a share compared with $ N million _3635_ four cents a share the previous year
lower prices for aluminum <unk> and certain <unk> products and a shift in the _3636_ mix also contributed to lower earnings the company said
in addition costs were higher partly due to _3637_ plant <unk> for modernization work the company said
excluding the higher tax rate which rose two percentage points to N N and the negative exchange rate adjustment the company would have met analysts ' expectations said r. wayne <unk> _3638_ analyst with goldman sachs & co
_3639_ that the third quarter is usually the aluminum industry 's <unk> mr. <unk> added the third quarter is never a bang up period for them anyway

for N years federal rules have barred the three major television networks from sharing in one of the most lucrative and fastest-growing parts of the television business
and for six years nbc abc and cbs have negotiated with hollywood studios in _3644_ <unk> attempt to change that
_3645_ with foreign companies <unk> up u.s. movie studios the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever
they hope the foreign deals will divide the hollywood opposition and <unk> congress to push for ending federal rules that prohibit _3646_ networks from <unk> a piece of <unk> sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air
even network _3647_ however admit privately that victory either in congress or in talks with the studios is highly doubtful any time soon
and so the networks also are pushing for new ways to <unk> the <unk> provisions known formally as the financial interest and <unk> _3648_
that became clear last week with the disclosure that national broadcasting co. backed by the deep _3649_ of parent general electric co. had tried to help fund qintex australia ltd. 's <unk> $ N billion bid for mgm\/ua communications co
nbc 's interest may revive the deal which mgm\/ua killed last week when the _3650_ concern had trouble raising cash
even if that deal _3651_ n't revived nbc hopes to find another
our doors are open an _3652_ spokesman says
nbc may yet find a way to take a passive minority interest in a <unk> without _3653_ the rules
and any nbc effort could prompt _3654_ inc. and abc 's parent capital cities\/abc inc. to look for ways of <unk> the <unk> regulations
but the networks ' push may only <unk> an increasingly bitter <unk> between them and hollywood _3655_
both sides are to sit down next month for _3656_ another meeting on how they might agree on reducing <unk> restraints
few people <unk> to the talks _3657_ the studios to <unk>
the networks still are <unk> in their authority over what shows get on the air charges motion picture association president jack <unk> the most <unk> opponent _3658_ <unk> the rules
studios are _3659_ to get shows in prime-time <unk> and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative <unk> sales he contends
and that 's why the rules for the _3660_ part must stay in place he says
studio executives in on the talks including officials at paramount communications inc. <unk> entertainment inc. warner communications inc. _3661_ mca inc. declined to be interviewed
but mr. <unk> _3662_ represents the studios asserts the whole production industry to a man is on the side of preserving the rules
such <unk> leave network officials all the more doubtful that the _3663_ will <unk>
they do n't seem to have an incentive to negotiate says one network _3664_
and there _3665_ no indication that washington is prepared to address the rules
that 's the _3666_ is n't it
_3667_ it is
congress has said repeatedly it _3668_ no part of the mess urging the studios and the networks which license rights to air shows made by the studios to work out their own compromise
but recent developments have made the networks and nbc president robert wright _3669_ particular ever more <unk> that the networks must be <unk> to survive
the latest <unk> sony corp. 's plan to acquire columbia _3670_ entertainment inc. for $ N billion and to buy independent producer guber peters entertainment co. for $ N million
i wonder what walter <unk> will think of the <unk> broadcast system <unk> evening news with dan rather broadcast exclusively from tokyo wrote <unk> <unk> an nbc vice president in a commentary in last week 's issue of broadcasting _3671_
in his article mr. <unk> who was in europe last week and _3672_ complained that the <unk> restraints in <unk> rules have contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by non-u.s. enterprises
he did n't mention that nbc in the meantime was hoping to assist _3673_ 's qintex in buying
an nbc spokesman <unk> that mr. <unk> _3674_ <unk> was entirely consistent with nbc plans because the u.s. rules would limit nbc 's involvement in the qintex deal so severely as to be light years away from the type of <unk> deals available to sony and everyone else except the three networks
the big three 's <unk> for deregulation began <unk> in the summer when the former time inc. went ahead with plans _3675_ acquire warner
although time already had a long-term contract to buy movies from warner the merger will _3676_ time 's largely <unk> <unk> channel home box office own the warner movies aired on hbo a <unk> integration that is effectively blocked by <unk> regulations
nbc 's mr. wright _3677_ the way in <unk> the networks ' inability to match a <unk> combination
he spoke up again _3678_ the sony bid for columbia was announced
since nbc 's interest in the qintex bid for mgm\/ua was disclosed mr. wright has n't been available for comment
with a qintex deal nbc would move into _3680_ territory possibly raising <unk> at the studios and in washington
it 's never really been tested says william <unk> iii who as a top cbs executive spent years lobbying to have the _3681_ lifted
he now runs _3682_ communications in washington consulting to media companies
<unk> rules do n't <unk> block a network from buying a passive small stake in a _3683_ that profits from the <unk> <unk> networks ca n't enjoy
hence nbc might be able to take say a N N stake in a company _3684_ as mgm\/ua
if the transaction raised objections the studio 's <unk> operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have _3685_ direct stake
but _3686_ <unk> would still block the networks from <unk> a big chunk of the <unk> of <unk>
under current rules even when a network fares well with a <unk> series abc for example made a killing in broadcasting its popular <unk> <unk> it is n't allowed to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns _3687_ sold to local stations
instead abc will have to sell off the rights for _3688_ one-time fee
the networks admit that the _3689_ of getting the relief they want are slim for several years at the least
six years ago they _3690_ <unk> close
the <unk> federal communications commission had ruled in _3691_ of killing most of the rules
various evidence including a <unk> institution study of some N series that the networks _3692_ aired and had partly owned in the 1960s showed the networks did n't <unk> <unk> control over the studios as had been alleged
but just eight days before the rules were to die former president ronald reagan a one-time actor intervened _3693_ behalf of hollywood
_3694_ fcc effort collapsed
the _3695_ and studios have <unk> ever since
network officials involved in the studio talks _3696_ hope the foreign influx builds more support in washington but that seems unlikely
in congress the issue <unk> it 's about money not program quality and hollywood has lots _3697_ clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue
a spokesman for rep. edward j. markey <unk> who heads a subcommittee that oversees the fcc says mr. markey feels the world _3698_ been forever changed by the <unk> deal
but he said mr. markey hopes this <unk> the networks and studios to work it out on _3699_ own
and at the fcc meanwhile new chairman alfred c. <unk> has said he wants _3700_ two sides to <unk> out their own plan

the company said it will continue to pursue a _3713_ of the suspension
intel corp. reported a N _3714_ drop in third-quarter net income partly because of a one-time charge for discontinued operations
the big semiconductor and computer maker said it had net of _3715_ N million or N cents down N N from $ N million or N cents a share
the lower net included a charge of $ N million equal to _3716_ cents a share on an after-tax basis for the cost of abandoning a <unk> joint venture with siemens ag of west germany
_3717_ also fell from the year-ago period because of slowing <unk> demand
sales amounted to _3718_ N million down N N from $ N million
intel 's stock rose in early over-the-counter trading friday as investors appeared relieved that the company 's income from continuing operations was only slightly below the second quarter 's earnings of $ _3719_ million or N cents a share and that sales actually exceeded the $ N million for the second period
but intel later <unk> to the stock _3720_ 's plunge closing at $ N down $ N
in august intel warned that third-quarter earnings might be flat to down from the previous period 's because of slowing sales growth of its N microprocessor start-up costs associated with a line of computers and costs of preparing for mass shipments of _3721_ company 's new N chip in the current quarter
on friday andrew <unk> intel president _3722_ chief executive officer said intel 's business is strong

walter sisulu and the african _3727_ congress came home yesterday
after N years in prison mr. sisulu the <unk> former <unk> of the liberation movement was dropped off at his house by a prison services ' van just as the sun was coming _3728_
at the same time six anc colleagues five of whom were arrested with him _3729_ N and sentenced to life <unk> were <unk> with their families at various places around the country
and as the <unk> men returned to their homes the anc outlawed in south africa since N and still considered to be the chief public enemy _3730_ the white government <unk> returned to the streets of the country 's black <unk>
a huge anc flag with black green and gold <unk> was <unk> over the _3731_ gate at mr. sisulu 's modest house while on the street out front boys displayed the anc colors on their shirts <unk> and <unk>
at the small <unk> home of <unk> <unk> a leading anc <unk> and a former <unk> in the group 's armed <unk> <unk> we <unk> <unk> stuck little anc flags in their hair and a man <unk> _3732_ an <unk> horn <unk> in anc <unk>
i am happy to see the spirit of the people said mr. _3733_ looking <unk> in a new gray suit
as _3734_ crowd outside his home shouted anc anc the old man shot his <unk> into the air
i 'm inspired by the mood _3735_ the people
under the laws of the _3736_ the anc remains an illegal organization and its headquarters are still in <unk> <unk>
but the <unk> release of the seven leaders who once formed the intellectual and <unk> core of the anc is a de <unk> <unk> of the movement and the <unk> of its internal _3737_
the government can never put the anc back into the bottle again _3738_ <unk> <unk> a veteran <unk> activist on hand to welcome mr. sisulu
things have gone too far _3739_ the government to stop them now
there 's _3740_ turning back
there was certainly no <unk> the tide of anc <unk> last night when hundreds of people <unk> into the <unk> cross <unk> church in <unk> for what became the first anc rally in the _3741_ in N years
<unk> <unk> of anc and <unk> we <unk> shook the church _3742_ the seven aging men vowed that the anc would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial <unk> on all fronts including the armed struggle
and they called on the government to release nelson <unk> the anc 's leading figure who _3743_ jailed with them and remains in prison
without _3744_ said mr. sisulu the <unk> of the others is only a <unk>
president <unk> de <unk> released the anc men along with one of the founding members of the pan <unk> congress a rival liberation group _3745_ part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government
but pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this <unk> divided country
as other <unk> governments particularly poland and the soviet union have recently discovered initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that _3747_ difficult if not impossible to control
as the days go by the south african government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued <unk> of mr. <unk> as well as the continued banning of the anc _3748_ enforcement of the state of emergency
if it does n't yield _3749_ these matters and eventually begin talking directly to the anc the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to <unk> and unrest
if _3750_ does the large number of <unk> whites who oppose any concessions to the black majority will step up their <unk> and threats to take matters into their own hands
_3751_ newly released anc leaders also will be under enormous pressure
the government is watching closely to see if their presence in the <unk> leads to increased <unk> protests and violence _3752_ it does pretoria will use this as a reason to keep mr. <unk> behind bars
pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life <unk> in the first place _3753_ sabotage and conspiracy to <unk> the government
in addition the government _3754_ figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the anc and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their <unk>
in order to head off any divisions _3755_ <unk> in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released instructed them to report to the anc headquarters in <unk> as soon as possible
the men also will be faced with <unk> the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many <unk> black <unk> _3756_ so-called young <unk> who are anxious to see the old <unk> in action
says peter <unk> president of the south african youth congress we will be expecting them to act like leaders of _3757_ anc
they never considered themselves to be _3758_ else
at last night 's rally they called on their <unk> _3759_ be firm yet disciplined in their opposition to apartheid
we <unk> discipline _3760_ we know that the government is very very sensitive said andrew <unk> another early <unk> leader who is now N
we want to see nelson <unk> and all our <unk> out of prison and if we are n't disciplined we may not see _3761_ here with us
